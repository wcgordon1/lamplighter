# Door Propped a Thumb

Service door propped a thumb-width, fresh wedge mark on paint.

Ivy crouched by the narrow opening, studying the sliver of darkness that shouldn't exist. The clocktower's service entrance had been sealed for decades according to the official records, another casualty of budget cuts and bureaucratic efficiency. But someone had wedged it open tonight, and the mark on the metal frame looked fresh enough to still smell of sawdust.

"Carrow?" Tamsin whispered.

They'd been watching the tower for twenty minutes, waiting for the evening shift change that would give them a window to approach. The festival crowds were building in Founders' Green, their voices carrying across the district in waves of anticipation and alcohol. Soon the official celebrations would begin, drawing attention away from the quieter places where the real work would be done.

But this felt too convenient. Service doors didn't prop themselves open, especially not on the night when unauthorized access could determine the fate of the city's Veil.

Ivy pressed her palm against the door frame, feeling for the vibrations that would tell her about the activity inside. The brass token at her throat had been restless all evening, warming and cooling in patterns that didn't match her heartbeat or the rhythm of her walking. Now it held steady at a temperature that meant proximity to active seam work, the kind of heat that came from Veil manipulation on a significant scale.

"Someone's down there," she said quietly. "Working the Keystone."

That changed everything. If Bram's people were already in the sub-basement, if they'd started the process of forcing the tower's resonance into alignment with their agenda, then the careful timing they'd planned might not matter. The Midnight Toll was still three hours away, but seam work could build pressure for hours before the final release.

"We go in?" Rooke asked.

Ivy studied the wedge that held the door open. It was carved from soft pine, the kind of wood that compressed easily and left obvious marks when removed. Someone had wanted this door to be discovered, had made sure the opening would be noticed by anyone watching the tower approaches.

Which meant it was either a trap or an invitation. Possibly both.

"Carrow wouldn't prop a door unless he wanted someone to find it," she said. "But that doesn't mean we're the only ones he's expecting."

Inside the doorway, she could smell the mixture of old oil and brass that meant heavy machinery in regular use. The clocktower's inner workings had been maintained for over a century, generations of caretakers keeping the gears aligned and the pendulum steady. But underneath those familiar scents was something sharper, the ozone edge that came from electrical work in places where electricity wasn't supposed to be.

The conduit collar they'd discovered in the City Works junction had been installed. Bram's people had found a way to tap municipal current directly into the Keystone's housing, creating the forced resonance that would tear the city's seams wider than they'd ever been torn before.

"Bell cadence," Ivy said, pulling out her lantern and checking the vent settings. "Match your breathing to the clapper rhythm. We'll need steady hearts if there's Level 2 activity down there."

She'd been practicing the bell cadence since their conversation with Carrow, learning to synchronize her breathing with the deep bronze notes that rolled across the district every quarter hour. It was harder than the march rhythm that had become second nature, requiring a longer pause between inhale and exhale that matched the bell's decay time. But it was also more grounding, the kind of rhythm that connected human awareness to the massive mechanical systems that kept the city functioning.

They slipped through the propped door one by one, Ivy leading with her lantern held low to avoid casting shadows that might be visible from the street. The service passage was narrow and steep, cut directly into the tower's stone foundation. Whoever had built it had prioritized function over comfort, creating a route that maintenance workers could use to reach the sub-basement without interfering with the public spaces above.

The stairs spiraled downward in a tight helix, following the curve of the tower's base. With each step, the oil and brass scents grew stronger, layered now with the metallic tang that came from live electrical work. Someone had been busy down here, installing equipment that wasn't part of the original clocktower design.

Halfway down, Ivy heard voices.

She held up a hand, stopping Tamsin and Rooke on the step behind her. The conversation was coming from the sub-basement chamber, echoing up through the stone in a way that made individual words difficult to distinguish. But the tones were clear enough: one voice confident and commanding, the other hesitant and uncertain.

"Can you make out what they're saying?" Tamsin whispered.

Ivy pressed her ear to the stone wall, using her Listener sensitivity to filter the echoes. The tower's acoustics were complex, shaped by decades of mechanical vibration and the natural resonance of the stone itself. But underneath the confusion of reflected sound, she could hear fragments of conversation that made her blood run cold.

"—timing is everything—"

"—if the resonance builds too fast—"

"—she'll have to choose—"

They were talking about her. Not about the Wardens in general or the night's operation, but specifically about Ivy and whatever choice they expected her to make. Which meant this wasn't just about installing a conduit collar and forcing the city's seams open. It was about manipulation, about creating circumstances that would pressure her into decisions she wouldn't normally make.

The brass token at her throat had gone cold now, not the gradual cooling of wrong phase but the sharp chill that meant immediate danger. Her Listener sensitivity was picking up harmonics that set her teeth on edge, frequencies that spoke of Veil manipulation without proper safeguards or care for consequences.

"Trap," she mouthed to her teammates.

But they'd come too far to turn back now. If Bram's people were already working the Keystone, if they'd begun the process of destabilizing the city's seam network, then someone needed to witness what they were doing. The collar installation would be evidence, but only if they could document it and get that documentation to people who had the authority to act.

They continued down the spiral stair, moving as quietly as stone and metal would allow. The voices grew clearer with each step, and Ivy began to recognize the speakers. Bram Dore's confident baritone, obviously comfortable with command and certain of his position. And someone else, a voice she didn't immediately recognize but that carried the nervous precision of an engineer working under pressure.

At the bottom of the stairs, the passage opened into a small antechamber that connected to the sub-basement proper. Through an archway, Ivy could see the glow of electric work lights and the shapes of people moving around the Keystone housing. The brass and iron cradle that held the city's anchor light sat in the center of the chamber, but it was surrounded now by equipment that had no business being there.

The conduit collar was exactly where they'd expected to find it, clamped around the Keystone's mounting bracket like a parasite feeding on its host. Electrical cables snaked away from the collar toward a control panel that hadn't been there the last time anyone had officially inspected the chamber. And standing beside the panel, studying readings on a meter that glowed with amber numbers, was Bram Dore himself.

He looked up as Ivy stepped into the archway, and his expression shifted from concentration to something that might have been relief.

"Ms. Merrin," he said, his voice carrying the warm authority that had made him popular with voters and effective in committee meetings. "I was hoping you'd find your way down here."

The trap was sprung. But Ivy had been expecting it, and she'd come prepared for whatever bargain Bram thought he could offer.

"Councilman," she said, keeping her voice level and her hands steady on the lantern. "Interesting work you're doing here."

"Essential work," Bram corrected. "The kind of work that requires people with your particular talents."

He gestured toward the Keystone housing, where the collar's electrical connections gleamed under the work lights. The setup was more sophisticated than she'd expected, with multiple redundancies and what looked like remote monitoring capability. This wasn't a crude sabotage job or a desperate improvisation. It was engineered infrastructure, designed to last and built to specific tolerances.

"You could hear her again," Bram said quietly.

The words hit like a physical blow, confirming what Ivy had suspected since their encounter at the Pike Steps. He knew about the stone memories, knew about her ability to sense the accumulated traces that previous Wardens had left in the tower's foundation. And he was prepared to use that knowledge as leverage.

"The Veil holds everything," he continued, moving closer to the Keystone housing. "Every moment of joy, every instant of connection. Your mother's laughter isn't gone, Ms. Merrin. It's just waiting for someone with the skill to bring it back."

Behind him, the engineer looked uncomfortable with the direction the conversation was taking. But he didn't speak, didn't challenge his employer's approach. He just continued to monitor the readings on his instruments, making small adjustments to keep whatever process they'd started running smoothly.

"All I need," Bram said, "is for you to attune the Keystone to the resonance we've established. Your Listener abilities are the missing piece, the element that will let us control the city's seam network with precision instead of hoping for the best."

Ivy felt the temptation like a weight in her chest. The promise of connection, of hearing her mother's voice one more time, of touching something that had been lost and finding it whole again. The brass token at her throat was warming now, responding to the electrical field generated by the collar's operation. If she reached out, if she let herself sink into the enhanced resonance, she might be able to find more than just traces and impressions.

But she'd already made her choice, standing on the Pike Steps with her hand against the stone. Memory wasn't message. Impression wasn't instruction. And the living city needed people who could choose its welfare over their own longing.

"I'll keep the living city," she said.

Bram's expression shifted, the warm authority replaced by something harder and more calculating. "Sentiment costs lives, Ms. Merrin. The seam network is destabilizing whether we control it or not. At least my way, we can direct the energy toward useful purposes."

"Your way tears the Veil apart."

"My way harnesses power that's been wasted for decades." He gestured toward the collar again, its lacquered band hiding the set screws that locked it in place. "The old methods are failing. Random seam activity, unpredictable timing, amateur volunteers trying to solve problems they don't understand. The city needs professional management, not folklore and superstition."

From the chamber entrance, Ivy could hear Tamsin and Rooke moving into position behind her. They were ready to act if the conversation turned violent, ready to provide whatever support she needed. But this wasn't a fight that could be won with lanterns and chalk lines. This was about choice, about what kind of city Greywater would become and who would make that decision.

"The Midnight Toll will provide all the resonance we need," Bram continued. "The thirteenth strike creates a phase offset that we can amplify and direct. By morning, the seam network will be stabilized under municipal control, and episodes like tonight will be things of the past."

He was lying, or at least not telling the whole truth. The collar wasn't designed to stabilize anything. It was designed to tear the Veil open in ways that would justify whatever emergency powers Bram thought he needed. The destabilization would create problems that only he could solve, making him indispensable and giving him authority over systems that had previously been managed by cooperation and accumulated wisdom.

"You don't understand what you're asking," Ivy said.

"I understand exactly what I'm asking." Bram's voice had gone clipped now, the warmth replaced by the kind of impatience that came from dealing with people who refused to see reason. "I'm asking you to help me save this city from its own traditions."

The engineer looked up from his instruments, concern visible on his face. "Mr. Dore, the resonance is building faster than we calculated. If we don't begin the attuning process soon—"

"Then Ms. Merrin will have to make her choice quickly."

Ivy studied the collar's installation, memorizing the placement of cables and the configuration of connections. The lacquered band that Bram had mentioned was visible now, a strip of glossy material that covered the set screws holding the device in place. If those screws could be loosened, if the collar could be removed or disabled, then the forced resonance would stop and the natural timing of the Midnight Toll could proceed without amplification.

But that would require getting close to the Keystone housing, and Bram wasn't going to let her approach unless she agreed to his terms.

"The city chose you," he said. "Your abilities, your heritage, your connection to the work that came before. Don't waste that gift on sentiment and superstition."

The light in the chamber looked bright and wrong, too harsh and too focused for the gentle amber that should have filled the space. The electrical enhancement was changing everything about the Keystone's operation, forcing it to produce effects it had never been designed to handle. By midnight, the accumulated stress would either tear the housing apart or create resonance patterns that would propagate through every seam in the district.

Ivy memorized the screws under the lacquer, counting them and noting their positions. If there was a way to remove the collar, those screws were the key. But first, she needed to get out of this chamber and back to the surface, where she could warn the others about what they were really facing.

The living city deserved better than this forced efficiency, this reduction of complex relationships to simple mechanical control. And she was going to make sure it got the chance to choose its own future.

"I've made my choice," she said, backing toward the chamber entrance. "And it's not you."
