# User Verification Protocol

## WHEN TO ASK USER BEFORE PROCEEDING:

### **Magic System Elements**
- Adding any new cadence not listed in bible/magic_rules.md
- Introducing new prop types not in bible/props_artifacts.md  
- Changing established order of operations (salt → chalk → lantern)
- Any seam level behavior not documented in canon

### **Character Development**
- Dialogue that contradicts established voice patterns from data/characters.json
- Character motivations not supported by existing arc progression
- New relationships or conflicts not outlined in chapter beats
- Personality traits that conflict with established characterization

### **Plot Progression**  
- Deviating from timeline.json schedule or locations
- Resolving open threads not planned in current chapter outline
- Adding subplot elements not referenced in existing canon
- Changing the stakes or conflicts from chapter_outlines.md

### **World Building**
- New locations not in data/locations.json or outline
- Historical facts about Greywater not established in canon
- Government/authority structures beyond what's established
- Cultural elements not implied by existing material

## VERIFICATION PHRASES TO USE:
- "This element isn't in the established canon. Should I..."
- "I notice this would contradict [specific fact]. How should I..."  
- "The outline doesn't specify this detail. Would you like me to..."
- "This would be a new magic system element. Should I add it or..."

## NEVER ASSUME:
- Character backstories beyond what's established
- Magic capabilities beyond documented rules
- City geography beyond mapped locations  
- Timeline events beyond timeline.json
- Relationship dynamics beyond character.json

**When in doubt, ask rather than invent. Canon accuracy beats creative liberty.**
