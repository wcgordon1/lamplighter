# Glassways

Lantern light multiplying in stacked mirrors, making a bright maze that hurt to look at directly.

Ivy squinted as they descended into the glazier's tunnel, following Tamsin through a landscape that belonged more in a funhouse than a municipal drainage system. Mirror panes leaned against every wall in precarious towers, their surfaces throwing lamp flames back and forth until the narrow space blazed with reflected fire.

"Careful," Tamsin whispered, her voice echoing strangely in the glass-lined passage. "Some of these are cracked. Sharp edges everywhere."

The tunnel was a forgotten spur of the old glassworks district, abandoned when the factory moved to cheaper land outside the city limits. The mirrors had been left behind—stock that was easier to store than transport, sheets of silvered glass that now created an unintentional labyrinth beneath the streets.

But that wasn't why they were here.

The first sign was the smell—mildew and something else, something that reminded Ivy of old glass backing left too long in damp air. Then came the sound: a soft dripping that didn't match the rhythm of water falling from pipes. Too irregular, like someone counting who'd forgotten the proper sequence.

Ivy felt it the moment they passed the third stack of mirrors: a coolness that had nothing to do with the underground air, a pressure that made her chest tight and her breath come short. The token at her throat had gone cold, not the mere coolness of wrong phase but the bone-deep chill that meant something was actively feeding on the Veil.

She pressed her palm against the tunnel wall, feeling for the vibrations she'd learned to recognize. The electrical resonance from the collars was riding through the infrastructure here, but there was something else—a disturbance in the natural patterns that suggested active consumption of Veil energy.

"Level four," she said quietly, and Tamsin nodded.

"Building for the last hour. The resonance from the collars is making everything worse." Tamsin checked her lantern vent, making sure the flame burned steady. "Shades have been gathering here since the testing started. We need to see how bad it gets."

They were here for training, but the kind of training you only got when the stakes were real. With the Midnight Toll approaching and the electrical resonance destabilizing seams across the district, the Wardens needed to know how to handle shade encounters without Kestrel's guidance. Better to learn in a controlled environment than to face the unknown during the festival crowds.

Rooke followed behind them, his lantern held low and his breathing careful. He'd been the most reluctant to come down here, but he'd also been the first to volunteer when Ivy explained the reasoning. If they were going to face level-four threats during the Toll, they needed to know what they were doing.

"Stay close," Ivy said as they moved deeper into the tunnel. "Don't make sudden movements. Shades are attracted to quick motion and sharp sounds."

The mirror reflections made navigation treacherous. Every surface threw back distorted images of their lanterns, creating the illusion of light coming from directions that didn't exist. Ivy found herself reaching for walls that weren't there, stepping around obstacles that were only reflections.

And in the shifting maze of light and glass, something else was moving.

At first it was just a sense of wrongness, a feeling that the shadows between the mirrors were deeper than they should be. The reflections seemed to lag behind their movements, creating an uncanny moment where Ivy could see herself in a mirror before she'd actually moved into position.

Then she caught glimpses of motion in the reflected light—darkness that flowed like liquid, pooling in the corners where the mirrors didn't quite reach. Not simple shadow, but something that absorbed light without giving it back, creating dead zones in the maze of reflections.

"There," Rooke said quietly, pointing to a gap between two mirror stacks where the air seemed to shimmer with heat distortion. "No, wait. There too."

Ivy followed his gaze and realized what he meant. The disturbances weren't isolated—they were connected, part of a larger pattern of wrongness that filled the spaces between the mirrors like fog. The whole tunnel was infested.

She looked closer and saw it: a shade, feeding on the disrupted Veil energy that seeped through the tunnel walls. It was hard to make out clearly—less a distinct shape than a disturbance in the air, like looking at something through water. But she could see the way it moved, following the currents of breath and warmth that their bodies generated.

The mirrors were making it worse, she realized. Each reflection multiplied the disturbance, creating not just visual echoes but actual duplications of the shade's presence. What should have been a single entity was being fractured and amplified by the silvered glass, turning one shade into dozens of partial manifestations.

"Just one," Tamsin said. "We can handle one."

Then the shade split.

It happened so fast that Ivy almost missed it. One moment there was a single disturbance in the air, the next there were two, then four, then too many to count. The shade hadn't multiplied—it had revealed itself, showing that what they'd taken for a single entity was actually a cluster of them, feeding together in the rich seam energy of the tunnel.

"Level four," Ivy said again, but with more urgency. "Multiple shades, actively feeding."

The air in the tunnel suddenly felt thinner, harder to breathe. The shades were pulling moisture and warmth from the environment, creating pockets of cold that made Ivy's lungs ache. She could feel them moving closer, drawn by the heat and carbon dioxide that the three of them were generating.

Each breath felt like work now, as if the air itself had become thick and resistant. Ivy's exhales came out as visible clouds, and frost began forming on the closest mirror surfaces. The temperature drop wasn't gradual—it was happening fast, the way air chills when a storm front moves through.

"They're feeding actively," Tamsin said, her voice tight with the effort of speaking. "This isn't just presence. They're consuming the warmth directly."

"No sudden moves," Ivy reminded the others, but even as she said it, one of the shades drifted too close to Rooke's lantern. The glass chimney fogged over instantly, and Rooke stepped back instinctively to protect the flame.

The motion triggered something. Every shade in the tunnel turned toward them—not gradually, but all at once, like a flock of birds responding to a signal. The aimless drifting stopped, replaced by purposeful movement that converged on their position. The air grew noticeably colder, and Ivy's next breath came shallow and sharp.

"They're hunting now," Tamsin said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Coordinated behavior. This is worse than level four. We need to work fast."

Ivy nodded, pulling out her salt tin. "Salt ring first. Around all three of us, with a home break toward the entrance."

She moved carefully, laying a circle of coarse salt on the tunnel floor while trying not to make any sudden gestures. The salt would create a barrier the shades couldn't cross easily, buying them time to set up more complex defenses.

But as she worked, more shades appeared in the mirrors. Not reflections of the ones already in the tunnel, but new ones, drawn by the feeding activity. The old glassworks had been built on a natural thin spot in the Veil, and the current resonance testing was making it even more attractive to entities that fed on disrupted patterns.

The salt line sparked as she laid it, each grain hitting the floor with a tiny hiss of energy. The shades pulled back from the barrier, but they didn't retreat. Instead, they began circling the perimeter, testing for weaknesses, pressing against the salt boundary wherever the line seemed thin.

"They're learning," Rooke observed, watching the coordinated probing behavior. "Testing the defenses."

"Finished," Ivy said, completing the salt ring and making sure the break pointed clearly toward their exit route. The opening faced the tunnel entrance, giving them a clear path to retreat if the situation deteriorated further. "Chalk next."

Tamsin was already moving, pulling mirror panes from the nearest stack and arranging them into a crude corridor that led from their salt ring toward a natural alcove in the tunnel wall. Her hands were steady despite the cold, but Ivy could see her breath fogging as she worked.

"The theory is sound," Tamsin said, positioning each mirror with careful attention to the angles. "Shades get confused by multiple reflections. They follow disturbances in the Veil, but mirrors create false disturbances—echoes of the real thing."

"Will that work?" Rooke asked, watching nervously as more shades gathered in the space between the mirror stacks. The entities were becoming more agitated, their movements faster and more erratic as they circled the salt barrier.

"In theory," Tamsin said, positioning the last mirror to complete her makeshift corridor. "If we can make them chase their own disturbances instead of ours, they'll get caught in a feedback loop. But the geometry has to be perfect. One wrong angle and they'll realize it's a trap."

The mirror corridor was an impressive feat of improvised engineering—seven panes arranged to create a path that seemed to lead deeper into the tunnel but actually curved back on itself. The reflections bounced back and forth, creating the illusion of infinite depth while actually containing the space in a closed circuit.

She pulled out her chalk and began drawing on the tunnel floor, creating a closed loop pattern that connected to the mirror corridor. It was more complex than the simple lattices Ivy had learned for structural bindings—a continuous line that curved back on itself, creating a circuit with no beginning and no end.

"Loop closed," Tamsin said, finishing the chalk work. "Now we need to settle them."

That was where the real challenge lay. Shades responded to rhythm and pattern, but they had to be calmed before they could be bound. Too much motion would agitate them further. Too little would leave them free to continue feeding.

Ivy checked her lantern vent and took a careful breath. "Waltz cadence. Three in, three out, steady and even. Don't stop until they settle."

She began the rhythm, breathing deep and slow while holding her lantern steady. "In two three, out two three."

Rooke joined her, his voice quiet but clear. "In two three, out two three."

Tamsin completed the pattern, her breathing synchronized with theirs. "In two three, out two three."

At first, the shades continued their agitated movement, pressing against the salt ring and creating patches of extreme cold wherever they clustered. But as the waltz cadence continued, something began to change. The frantic motion slowed, becoming more purposeful. The shades began to follow the rhythm of their breathing, drifting in time with the three-count pattern.

Ivy could feel the shift happening—not just in the shades' behavior, but in the air around them. The oppressive cold began to ease slightly, becoming less sharp, less aggressive. The entities were still feeding, but the feeding was becoming synchronized with their breathing, creating a harmony instead of a destructive drain.

"It's working," Rooke said quietly, not breaking cadence. "In two three, out two three."

The waltz rhythm was having an unexpected effect. Instead of simply calming the shades, it was organizing them, turning their chaotic feeding into something more like a dance. They moved in flowing patterns now, their disturbances creating waves in the air that matched the three-count breathing.

"They're beautiful," Tamsin whispered, wonder in her voice despite the danger. "In two three, out two three."

And they were. Seen this way, responding to rhythm instead of hunting frantically, the shades looked less like threats and more like living expressions of the Veil itself—patterns made visible, disturbances that danced instead of destroyed.

The shades were moving toward the mirror corridor now, drawn by the reflections that seemed to pulse in time with their breathing. As they entered the corridor, the mirrors multiplied their images, creating a confusing maze of disturbances that made the shades harder to track but easier to control.

"In two three, out two three," Ivy continued, feeling the responsibility of maintaining the rhythm that kept them all safe. She watched as the last of the visible shades drifted into the mirror maze and disappeared into the chalk loop at the far end. The loop would confuse them, making them chase their own reflections until the binding energy dissipated and they dissolved back into harmless Veil disturbance.

They held the cadence for twelve full cycles, ensuring that all the shades had been caught in the loop and settled. The air in the tunnel gradually warmed back to normal temperature, and Ivy's breathing eased as the pressure on her chest lifted.

"Loop closed. Hold," Tamsin said finally, letting the cadence fade. "I think we got them all."

The tunnel felt different now—still strange with all the mirrors, but no longer actively dangerous. The shades had been neutralized, their feeding disruption contained within the chalk loop until it could dissipate naturally.

"How long will that hold?" Rooke asked, eyeing the mirror corridor with suspicion.

"Hours, maybe days," Tamsin said, gathering up the spare mirrors and stacking them safely out of the way. "Depends on how much the resonance testing continues to destabilize things."

Ivy pulled out her logbook and added a new stamp: SHADE-ACTIVITY, with the time, location, and cadence used. It was important to document everything, especially techniques that worked. If they faced shades during the festival, they'd need to know exactly what procedures to follow.

"Mirror clips," Tamsin said, producing a handful of small metal clips from her kit. "For building corridors quickly. I made these after reading about shade work in the Pike Diary."

She demonstrated how the clips could hold mirror panes in specific angles, creating stable reflection patterns even when working fast under pressure. It was clever engineering, the kind of practical innovation that made the difference between successful binding and disaster.

"Add them to standard kit," Ivy said, pocketing several clips. "If the resonance gets worse, we'll need every advantage we can get."

They packed up their equipment and prepared to leave the tunnel, but Ivy found herself looking back at the mirror corridor they'd built. It was crude but effective, a solution born from understanding how shades actually behaved rather than just following procedure from a manual.

"No metal strikes," she said, more to herself than to the others.

"What?" Rooke asked.

"The lesson. No metal strikes, no sudden motions. Shades aren't monsters you fight. They're disruptions you settle." Ivy adjusted her lantern strap and checked the salt ring one more time, making sure their exit route was clear. "Reflection and rhythm are the tools."

As they climbed back toward street level, Ivy found herself thinking about what they'd just accomplished. Three trainees with improvised equipment had faced down a level-four shade manifestation and won—not through violence, but through understanding. They'd turned the shades' own nature against them, using mirrors and rhythm to transform hunting entities into something almost harmless.

It was a lesson that went beyond the immediate threat. The Wardens weren't warriors fighting monsters. They were custodians, maintaining the balance between the ordinary world and the forces that lived in the spaces between. Violence would only make things worse. But patience, skill, and the right kind of knowledge could turn even the most dangerous encounters into something manageable.

"The festival crowds," Rooke said as they reached the surface. "If the resonance testing creates more shade activity like this..."

"We'll be ready," Ivy said, touching the mirror clips in her pocket. "We know what we're doing now."

The festival crowds were gathering, the resonance testing was continuing, and somewhere in the distance she could hear music and laughter as Greywater prepared for its biggest celebration of the year.

But now she knew something the crowds didn't: when the seams went wide, when the shades came hunting, they had ways to fight back. Not with force, but with patience. Not with weapons, but with mirrors and breath and the steady rhythm of hearts that refused to panic.

The air above ground tasted sweet after the closeness of the tunnel, and the lamp halos looked perfectly round in the evening fog. Normal. Safe.

For now.
