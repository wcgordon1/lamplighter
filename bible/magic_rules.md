# Magic Rules — Greywater (Lamplighter Craft)
> Canon reference for **The Lamplighter’s Daughter**. Treat this as the single source of truth for how the city’s “craft” behaves. It’s physics-adjacent folklore: **cadence + geometry + materials**, not spell words.

---

## 0) TL;DR (Design Pillars)
- **Seams** are **stress gaps** between ordinary space and what’s-beside-it. They hum, chill, tug. They are **not portals** to another world.
- **The Veil** is the city’s boundary membrane—its *skin*. Wardens stabilize it so everyday life (tides, traffic, warmth, timekeeping) remains coherent.
- **Three tools, three jobs:**  
  - **Salt** stalls. **Fast**, fragile, bodily/household protection. Seconds.  
  - **Chalk** shapes. **Structural** geometry that routes force. Minutes–hours.  
  - **Lantern** binds/tunes. **Living light** set by breath cadence. Heartbeats unless **primed**; Keystone extends to **district** scale.
- **Order matters:** **Salt → Chalk → Lantern.** Reversing risks tearing a waking seam wider.
- **Costs are real:** Overbinding = headaches, copper taste, nosebleeds; rest + sugar water. Wet chalk = lures. Closed rings require a marked exit.

---

## 1) Definitions & Model

### 1.1 Seams
- **Definition:** Local misalignments where patterns (sound, heat, motion) slip out of phase. Think **hairline fractures** in reality’s masonry.
- **What they do:** Siphon small things (heat, paper, breath), distort sound, skew direction, produce **shades** if they feed.
- **Where they form:**  
  - **Rhythmic nodes:** clock/bell cycles, tide pulses, trolley lines.  
  - **Repeated edges:** arches, thresholds, culverts, lintels.  
  - **Old iron & bell-metal:** conduct cadence better than other materials.

### 1.2 The Veil
- **Definition:** Emergent field made by a city’s rhythms, infrastructure, and human presence. The Veil is **thicker** where patterns are stable (regular light, bell time, foot traffic) and **thin** where neglected or forcibly synchronized wrong.
- **Why it matters:** Thin Veil → headaches, wrong echoes, “cold wind that smells like wet paper,” missing heat/air. Stable Veil → city works.

---

## 2) Sensing & Severity

### 2.1 Field Indicators (ranked by reliability)
1) **Hum** felt in molars/fingertips (Listeners hear cadence outright).  
2) **Temperature dip** (1–3°C) localized; exposed skin prickles.  
3) **Lamp halos thin** or “oval” instead of round.  
4) **Airflow** that ignores weather; papers creep in one direction.  
5) **Animal behavior:** dogs avert gaze, go still (Button), birds detour.

### 2.2 Severity Scale (log with each incident)
| Level | Name        | Signs                                                  | Risk                               |
|------:|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 1     | Hairline    | faint hum; dust eddies; no pull                       | log & move on                      |
| 2     | Waking      | sharper chill; halo thinning; breath short             | stall with salt; shape with chalk  |
| 3     | Open        | directional pull; paper/ash moves; sound skews        | bind quickly; keep civilians clear |
| 4     | Feeding     | **shades** present; glass sweats; voices distant       | mirror loop; bind w/ waltz         |
| 5     | Rupture     | structural warping; drafts slam; vertigo              | Keystone assist; evacuate          |

## 3) Materials & Methods

### 3.1 Salt (stall)
- **What:** Halite (sea/coarse/rock). The craft listens to **crystal structure**, not purity marketing.
- **Patterns:**  
  - **Spiral** (fine sea salt): quick lay; best to stall drift along floors.  
  - **Ring** (coarse rock): bodies/objects; wind-resistant. **Always leave a “home break.”**  
  - **Trip line** (fine): across a threshold to catch micro-pulls.
- **Duration:** 30–120 sec (dry surface); faster decay when walked through.  
- **Do/Don’t:** Do mark a **break** toward safety; don’t lay near drains (wash-out).  
- **Sensory:** Mineral rasp; stings cuts; tastes metallic in overbinding events.

### 3.2 Chalk (shape)
- **Types:**  
  - **River (white):** adheres to damp stone; default.  
  - **Shell (gray):** slightly rain-shedding; for iron/railings.  
  - **Slate (yellow):** warning/visibility under amber lamps.
- **Line Library:**  
  - **Lattice:** cross-hatching; routes stress to anchors (rails, lintels).  
  - **Chevron:** directional arrows; point **homeward** (ascending street numbers or nearest public light).  
  - **Loop:** closed figure used with mirrors to corral **shades**.  
  - **Null mark:** angled cross to kill smeared lines before redraw.
- **Duration:** 20–90 min depending on humidity & traffic.  
- **Failure Modes:** Smear = **lure**; incomplete lattice = **whistle** (seam oscillates). Wipe fully with **sand eraser** pouch, then redraw.

### 3.3 Lanterns (bind/tune)
- **Principle:** Mantle light carries **cadence** set by human breath; living rhythm overrides machine error—**why a Listener matters**.
- **Grades:** reading-room (light duty), workhorse (patrol), senior/sun-warmed (large spaces).  
- **Priming:** 2 breath cycles; thumb on vent; exhale **low–low–high**; extends bind to ~10–20 heartbeats.  
- **Costs:** Overbinding → headache, copper taste; log rest; **sugar water**.
- **Don’t:** Wave wildly or talk through cadence; motion desynchronizes.

### 3.4 Keystone Lantern (anchor)
- **Seat:** Clocktower sub-basement cradle on dampers.  
- **Effect:** District-scale stabilization when **Listener**-attuned with **salt prism** seated.  
- **Interaction with bell:** Must stay **in phase** with tower bell. Thirteenth strike (Midnight Toll) creates a **phase offset**—normally harmless, dangerous if **amplified** (see §8.2).  
- **Failure:** External current via **Conduit Collar** or off-phase bell widens seams citywide.

## 4) Cadence Catalogue (breath counts you’ll actually use)

> Count **breaths**, not seconds. Keep jaw unclenched; shoulders down.

| Name        | Count (In/Out)             | Use Case                                   | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------|
| **March**   | **2 / 2**                   | Standard binding for Levels 2–3             | Default “city walking” rhythm; steady, unshowy. |
| **Waltz**   | **3 / 3** (even-three)      | **Shades** calming; mirror corridor work    | Don’t rush; imagine a slow turn. |
| **Tide**    | **2–3 / 2**                 | Riverfront; promenade rails; drifty pulls   | Inhale 2; exhale 3; inhale 2; repeat. |
| **Latch**   | **1 / 2 (short-long)**      | Pin small seams on doors/frames temporarily | Only in combo with chalk chevrons. |
| **Bell**    | **2 / hold / 2**            | Under bell strikes; align with clapper echo | Rooke used before early ring (Ch21). |
| **Lull**    | **4 / 4**                   | Post-event settling; aftercare              | Lowers overbinding symptoms. |
| **Heartbeat** | **match pulse**           | **Keystone attunement** (Listener only)     | Ivy’s key at climax; overrides machine phase. |

*Tip:* Whisper the **shape** instead of counting: “in-two, out-two” / “in-two-three, out-two-three.”

## 5) Shades & Other Phenomena

### 5.1 Shades
- **Nature:** Aerated residues—pattern-hunters formed when seams feed on breath/heat. They are **not spirits**; they’re **mispatterned drafts**.
- **Attracted to:** respiration, quick motion, heat plumes.  
- **Avoid/Confuse:** mirrored light, closed loops, steady **waltz**.  
- **Protocol:**  
  1) Don’t run/shout.  
  2) Lay **salt ring**.  
  3) Build **mirror corridor** leading into chalk **loop**.  
  4) Lantern **waltz** for 8–12 cycles, then **lull**.  
- **Harm:** Suffocation, disorientation, falls. No blades; metal scatters them, then they reconverge.

### 5.2 Cold Wind (“wet paper wind”)
- **Source:** Level-2 seam venting through HVAC/vents/drains.  
- **Fix:** Salt **trip line** at vent; chalk **chevrons** pointing out; **latch** cadence.

### 5.3 Wrong Echo
- **Source:** Lattice mismatch or bell off-phase; words come back **before** they’re spoken.  
- **Fix:** Erase faulty cross; re-draw to nearest rail anchor; switch to **march** then **tide** if by river.

## 6) Operations (SOP)

### 6.1 Field SOP (every call)
1) **Sight** — Confirm with two indicators (hum + halo or temp).  
2) **Clear** — Move civilians; **no phones/flash** (desync risk; also distracts).  
3) **Stall** — Lay **salt**: spiral for ground drift, ring for bodies/objects (mark **home break**).  
4) **Shape** — Draw **chalk**: lattice to anchors; chevrons toward public light/ascending numbers; loop only for **shades**.  
5) **Bind** — Lantern cadence: **march** default; **waltz** for shades; **tide** riverside; **latch** for doors/frames; **heartbeat** only for Keystone.  
6) **Record** — Log time, drop, cadence, materials, civilians, injuries. Stamp the page.

### 6.2 Keystone SOP (restricted)
- **Pre-check:** dampers intact; Conduit Collar **absent**; bell phase checked.  
- **Attune:** Listener palm to vent, **heartbeat** cadence; **Vent Wheel** +¼ notch if ringing.  
- **Maintain:** Hold for 12 cycles; switch to **lull**; step back; observe lamps districtwide for stable halos.  
- **Abort:** If ozone smell + mantle glare → **power injection** suspected. Kill mains; remove collar; retune.

---

## 7) Safety, Costs, Recovery
- **Overbinding signs:** copper taste, temple ache, nosebleed, fingertip tingling.  
  - **Remedy:** sit; **lull** cadence × 6; **sugar water**; 24h no solo work.  
- **Environmental hazards:** wet chalk = **lure**; avoid storm drains; never bind on a metal grate (oscillations echo).  
- **Team rules:** Never split alone beneath City Works; pairs minimum; **rope** on incline stairs; whistle on you.  
- **Animals:** Button is an early warning—respect his freeze/avoidance.

---

## 8) Festival & Infrastructure Interactions

### 8.1 Lamp Grid & Trolley
- **Conductors:** Copper lines carry seam hums; insulators may “sing.”  
- **Practice:** Listen along lines to triangulate; don’t hang lantern from live wire brackets.

### 8.2 Midnight Toll (thirteenth strike)
- **Tradition:** Annual extra bell strike for the first lamplighters.  
- **Physics/folklore:** Adds a **phase offset** for a few breaths—harmless under normal counters.  
- **Bram’s exploit:** Disabled counters + Conduit Collar surge + bell off-phase = **forced opening**.  
- **Counter-play (canon):** Tamsin’s **clapper wedges** (+ early ring by Rooke) break timing; Ivy’s **heartbeat** bind overrides machine phase; Keystone stabilizes.

---

## 9) Troubleshooting (Field Guide)

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| Salt ring “pulls” inward | No **home break**; vacuum effect | Open break toward **light**; switch to **march** |
| Lattice whistles | Crossing angles off; partial smear | Erase with sand pouch; redraw; re-anchor to rail |
| Lantern flare, no bind | Talking through cadence; hand shake | Reset stance; **priming** breath; try **tide** |
| Shades keep splitting | Too much motion; metal strikes | Freeze; mirror corridor; **waltz** cadence |
| Ozone smell near Keystone | **Conduit Collar** active | Kill mains; remove collar; **heartbeat** retune |
| Wrong echo in speech | Bell off-phase or misdrawn lattice | **Bell** cadence briefly; correct chalk; resume |

---

## 10) Roles & Talents (who excels at what)
- **Listener** (Ivy): hears cadences; can **attune Keystone**; best at heartbeat binds.  
- **Binder** (Kestrel): chalk geometry; legal remediation & permits; lamp-blink coordination.  
- **Tinkerer** (Tamsin): lamp maintenance; clapper wedges; grid reroutes; gear jamming under stress.  
- **Rescuer** (Rooke): knots/hauls; breath coaching; bell-stair readiness; early ring courage.

---

## 11) Legal & Ethical Bounds
- **No property entry** without cause or Library permit (paper trail).  
- **No “demonstration binds”** for press; craft is for safety, not spectacle.  
- **Civilian first rule:** choose living over lost echoes (Ivy’s choice at climax is canon).  
- **Evidence handling:** seize dangerous retrofits (Conduit Collar) and log chain of custody (Mara’s invoices → warrant).

---

## 12) Incident Logging (schema)
Every chapter that includes craft should produce a continuity card entry plus this minimal log (keep with the field logbook).

```json
{
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm",
  "location": "Clock Quarter / Sub-basement stair",
  "level": 3,
  "indicators": ["halo-thin", "2°C drop", "hum strong"],
  "salt": {"type": "rock", "pattern": "ring", "break": "east"},
  "chalk": {"type": "river", "pattern": "lattice→rail", "notes": "chevrons north"},
  "lantern": {"cadence": "march", "primed": true, "cycles": 10},
  "shades": {"present": false},
  "injuries": [],
  "outcome": "bound",
  "notes": "trolley line sang; token warmed on cadence"
}
```
### 13) Canon Constraints (do-not-break list)

* Craft = cadence + geometry + materials. No incantations, no teleports, no mind control.
* Salt → Chalk → Lantern order except in documented edge cases.
* Listener-only for Keystone attunement. Others can maintain, not set.
* No new tools appear mid-book without an entry here and a cost.
* The Veil is a civic concern; Wardens serve the city, not secrecy for its own sake.

### 14) Anchored Examples (chapter cross-refs for writers)

* Ch3 (Harbor Suds): Ivy lays a salt spiral; Kestrel binds with reading-room lantern; introduces order of operations.
* Ch9 (Promenade): Team uses chalk lattice on railing + tide cadence to counter river pull; Rooke rescues a teen.
* Ch15 (Glazier’s Tunnel): Mirror corridor + loop pattern; waltz cadence settles shades.
* Ch20–21 (Clocktower): Clapper wedges adjust bell; Conduit Collar spotted; Ivy performs heartbeat attunement; lull cadence for aftercare.

### 15) Glossary (quick pulls)

* Anchor: A structure (rail, lintel) that will carry a chalk lattice’s load.
* Attune: Match Lantern/Keystone cadence to a living rhythm (Listener).
* Bind: Close or stabilize a seam via lantern light.
* Break (ring): Deliberate opening aimed toward home (light/safety).
* Homeward: Direction of safety—public light or ascending street numbers.
* Listener: Person who perceives seam cadence distinctly (Ivy).
* Overbinding: Physiological cost from prolonged binding; recover per §7.
* Phase: Relative timing between bell, grid, and breath.
* Waltz/March/Tide/Latch/Lull/Bell: Cadence patterns in §4.
