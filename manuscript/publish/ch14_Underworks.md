# Chapter 14: Underworks

City Works bay, where the air tasted metallic and the shadows held too much geometry.

Ivy followed Tamsin down the access ladder, her route keys heavy at her belt and her breath careful in the ozone-thick air. The bay stretched ahead of them like the inside of some vast machine, all conduit racks and valve wheels and warning placards that flickered in the harsh white inspection lights.

"Stay close," Tamsin whispered, though her voice seemed to carry further than it should in the enclosed space. "These passages connect to the tide network, but the layout changes depending on what's running."

Rooke dropped down behind them, landing soft on the grated floor. The metal sang once under his weight, a clear note that made Ivy's token pulse warm against her throat. Level-2 seam energy riding the infrastructure, just like Tamsin had predicted.

They'd entered through the Library Row access, using Ivy's silver route key on a maintenance door that technically shouldn't have opened for trainee-level authorization. But Tilda's emergency protocols had temporarily elevated their access permissions, and Tamsin had argued that investigating unauthorized electrical work fell under their infrastructure safety mandate.

"Technically," she'd said, producing a sheaf of copied regulations. "Municipal Code Section 147: any person observing hazardous electrical conditions in public infrastructure is required to document and report to proper authorities. We're not trespassing. We're conducting a safety inspection."

The regulations looked official enough, stamped and photocopied from the city archives. Whether they'd hold up under scrutiny was another question, but they gave the team legal cover for the next few hours.

Now, moving through the maze of City Works with stolen authority and borrowed time, Ivy wondered if Tamsin's technical arguments would matter if they got caught. The bay stretched ahead like the interior of some vast organ, all arteries and valves and nodes where different systems intersected. Steam rose from vents in the floor, carrying the smell of hot metal and chemical treatment additives. Warning signs proliferated on every surface: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY, HIGH VOLTAGE, CONFINED SPACE.

"Layout's changed since the last official inspection," Tamsin said, consulting a schematic that was already six months out of date. "They've added new junction points, rerouted some of the main feeds." She pointed to a cluster of pipes that didn't appear on her diagram. "That's recent work. Very recent."

The bay opened into a junction where six tunnel mouths led off in different directions. Numbers painted on the walls: G-7, G-8, G-12. The clocktower lay somewhere beyond G-12, but the passage was dark and the air that drifted from it carried a wrong smell like heated copper.

"That way," Tamsin said, pointing to G-8. "Parallels the main route but connects to the sub-basement junction. Less direct, but more cover."

They entered G-8, and the world narrowed to the circle of Tamsin's lantern and the sound of their footsteps on wet concrete. The tunnel was older here, carved from bedrock and lined with fitted stone that wept mineral stains in long vertical streaks. Maintenance conduits ran along the ceiling, tagged with numbers and color codes that marked different utility systems: water, power, communications, gas.

Ivy could hear the tide network flowing somewhere beyond the walls, a low pulse that seemed to match her heartbeat but ran just slightly fast. The token at her throat grew warmer, responding to something in the infrastructure that wasn't quite right. The rhythm of the water carried harmonics that sounded artificial, shaped by systems that weren't part of the original design.

"Listen," she said, pressing her palm against the tunnel wall.

The others stopped. In the quiet, they could hear it: a deep thrumming that rode through the stone and metal, synchronized to something outside their immediate range. Not random mechanical noise, but organized vibration with mathematical precision.

"That's not flood control," Tamsin said. "That's..." She frowned, trying to place the pattern. "Resonance testing. Someone's running frequency sweeps through the system."

"Now?" Rooke asked.

"Preparation. You'd want to map the harmonic response before you tried anything major." Tamsin touched the wall herself, feeling the vibration through her fingertips. "This is baseline measurement. Finding the frequencies that make the whole system ring."

"Fan drone," Rooke said quietly, and Ivy heard it too: the steady whir of ventilation equipment that meant they were approaching occupied spaces. But underneath the mechanical noise, that deeper thrumming continued, patient and purposeful.

G-8 branched into a maintenance corridor lined with pipe runs and electrical panels. Emergency lighting cast everything in harsh blues and yellows, and the air hummed with transformer noise that made Ivy's teeth ache. She counted her breaths; in two, out two; using march cadence to keep steady as the seam pressure built.

Tamsin stopped at a junction box marked with a number Ivy didn't recognize: CB-47-K. "This should feed the clocktower sub-basement. Let me check the routing."

She opened the box with a maintenance key, revealing a nest of cables thick as her wrist. But instead of the standard municipal wiring, Ivy saw something that didn't belong: a ceramic-brass adapter collar clamped around one of the main feeder lines.

"That's not maintenance," Tamsin said, her voice gone flat.

"Then it's sabotage," Ivy replied, leaning closer. The collar was beautiful in its own way, precision-machined ceramic housing with brass fittings that gleamed like jewelry. But it didn't match any of the municipal electrical codes she'd studied, and the grub screws that held it in place were lacquered black to hide tool marks.

"Look at this," Rooke said from across the corridor. He was examining another junction box, this one hanging open to reveal similar modifications. "Three more adapters. All feeding toward the tower."

Ivy felt the hairs on her forearms rise as she approached the collar. Not from static electricity, but from something else: a low-frequency hum that seemed to ride through the metal conduits and into her bones. The seam energy was stronger here, focused and shaped by the electrical modifications.

The collar was beautiful work: precision-machined ceramic and brass fittings crafted to tolerances tighter than jewelry. Whoever had designed this understood both electrical engineering and the subtle physics of seam dynamics.

"This wasn't slapped together," Tamsin said, running her fingers along the mounting points. "This is specialist work."

She pulled out her notebook, sketching quickly. "Someone's building a resonance circuit. These aren't just taps; they're tuned to specific frequencies. Each resonance chamber amplifies a different harmonic."

"For what?"

"Forced harmonics. Pump current at the right frequency and you can make the whole structure ring like a..." Tamsin stopped, her pencil frozen. She looked up at the collar, face going pale. "Multiple feed points. This is designed to work with others. It's part of a network."

She trailed off, staring at her own drawing.

"What?" Ivy asked.

"The Midnight Toll. Thirteen strikes instead of twelve." Tamsin looked up from her notebook. "What if the extra bell strike isn't tradition? What if it's a trigger?"

The pieces clicked together in Ivy's head like tumblers in a lock. The festival timing, the permit restrictions that kept Wardens away from the tower, Cole's detailed reports about their emergency procedures. Someone had been planning this for months.

"We need photos," Rooke said. "Documentation. Part numbers, serial codes, anything that shows this wasn't authorized work."

Ivy pulled out the camera, shooting the collar from multiple angles. The invoice stickers told the story: "Greywater Technical Solutions," municipal contractor license, and at the bottom; "Installation certified by G. Morrison, PE."

Morrison. Judge Morrison had signed Kestrel's detention order. Now his name appeared on electrical work that shouldn't exist.

A sound echoed from deeper in the tunnel system. Footsteps, maybe. Or equipment cycling on.

"Move," Tamsin whispered.

"There's more," Tamsin said, moving deeper into the corridor. She'd found a service panel that opened onto the main feeder junction, where three separate collar assemblies fed power toward different areas of the tower complex. "They're not just targeting the sub-basement. This is district-wide infrastructure modification."

Ivy followed her to the main junction, where electrical feeds branched like roots. Each branch had been fitted with its own collar assembly: professional work, approved stickers on every one.

"This isn't vandalism," Tamsin said, her voice flat. "This is an inside job. They've got people in contracting, permits, inspection. Planning this for months."

Ivy photographed rapidly. Every collar was precision work, every invoice stamped with official approval; proof of systematic sabotage through legitimate channels.

The footsteps echoed again, closer now. Definitely footsteps.

"How much power?" she asked as Tamsin measured voltage readings.

"Enough to light up half the old quarter. But they're turning the electrical grid into a giant tuning fork." Tamsin's meter showed frequencies in mathematical progression. "Force the whole district into resonance and..."

"Every seam opens at once," Ivy finished, her chest tight. The Keystone Lantern sat connected to these same power systems.

"We have to stop this," she said.

"We have to prove it first," Rooke corrected. "If we start pulling collars now, we're vandals. If we document everything and bring it to the right people..."

"What right people?" Tamsin asked. "Kestrel's detained. Cole leaked our operational plans. Bram controls the festival security."

"The police," Ivy said. "Sergeant Morrow. He seemed decent enough, just following orders."

"Orders from who?" Tamsin's smile was bitter. "Same people who signed off on these modifications."

They worked fast, photographing and documenting. The seam energy grew stronger as they moved closer to the tower, and Ivy found herself counting breaths; in two, out two; using march cadence to stay steady.

"Look at the dates," Rooke said, pointing to work order stamps. "Installation started six weeks ago, approvals last week. They built this piece by piece so no one sees the whole picture."

The footsteps were definitely getting closer. A beam of light swept across the tunnel entrance behind them.

"Someone's coming," Ivy whispered.

The tide network pulsed beneath their feet with artificial rhythm. The collars were already working, shaping the city's natural flows.

"Can you hear it changing?" Ivy pressed her palm against a water main.

"The whole system's starting to synchronize," Tamsin said, listening through the metal. "Maybe eighteen hours until it's fully ready. Just in time for the Midnight Toll."

The light beam swept closer. Voices now, echoing through the tunnels.

"Last junction," Tamsin said urgently, leading them to a service vault under the clocktower's foundation. The space was cramped, the air crackling with electrical tension that made the lantern flames dance wrong.

The final collar assembly was larger than the others, a complex device that connected to multiple feeder lines and included what looked like a timing circuit: precise electronic components that could synchronize electrical pulses to external signals.

"Bell trigger," Ivy said, photographing rapidly. "Thirteenth strike sends a signal, coordinates the surge."

"Like a bomb," Rooke said quietly. "Except it opens every seam in the district at once."

Ivy thought about crowds gathering for the Midnight Toll, thousands of people pressed together when the seams went wide. Level-5 across the entire district, no warning, no preparation.

The voices were getting louder. Flashlight beams danced across the tunnel walls behind them.

"Thirty-six hours," Tamsin said, closing her notebook. "That's all we have."

"Go," Tamsin whispered.

They moved fast through the tunnels, Ivy's camera heavy with evidence that could save the city or get them killed. Behind them, voices echoed closer, searching.

The access ladder felt endless, each rung a step back toward a fragile world. Below, the collars hummed their patient countdown.

At street level, fog was rolling in from the harbor, turning the lamp halos soft and diffuse. Festival banners hung from the lamp posts like colorful prayers, and in the distance Ivy could hear music and laughter as the first crowds began to gather.

She touched the camera in her pocket, feeling the weight of evidence that might save the city or might get them killed for knowing too much. Either way, they were committed now.

"What's next?" Rooke asked as they walked back toward the library.

"We find someone who'll listen," Ivy said. "And we pray they believe us."
