# Chapter 2: Stacks and Strays

Frosted-glass skylights threw pale squares across the long tables where Ivy sat with a book she wasn't reading. The Greywater Public Library felt like a church for paper instead of prayer, all whispered conversations and careful footsteps on polished floors.

She wanted a place to sit that wasn't watched, but Ms. Kestrel at the reference desk had the kind of eyes that catalogued everything. Twice already, the librarian had glanced up when Ivy shifted in her chair, and once when she'd flinched as the reading lamp above her flickered.

Not flickered—the halo had gone oval, stretched thin like a coin seen edge-on. The light steadied again before anyone else seemed to notice, but Ms. Kestrel's gaze had sharpened.

"Reading anything interesting?" The voice came from behind Ivy's shoulder, quiet but carrying the authority of someone who owned every book in sight.

Ivy looked up to find Ms. Kestrel standing beside her table, hands ink-stained and precise. She was older than June, with silver streaking her dark hair and lines around her eyes that suggested years of squinting at small print.

"Just browsing," Ivy said, closing the book on local history she'd been pretending to read.

"Mmm." Ms. Kestrel glanced at the lamp overhead, then back at Ivy. "That one's been acting up lately. The light says more than it shows, if you know how to listen."

The token around Ivy's neck warmed slightly, as if responding to something in the librarian's voice. "I'm not sure what you mean."

"Do you hear that?" Ms. Kestrel tilted her head slightly, and Ivy realized she wasn't talking about voices or footsteps. There was something else—a low hum, barely perceptible, like the house frame last night but fainter.

"Feels like a thread under my skin," Ivy said before she could stop herself.

Ms. Kestrel's expression shifted, professional interest giving way to something more focused. "Useful thread." She moved around to the chair across from Ivy and sat down, her voice dropping lower. "Mind if I try something?"

Before Ivy could answer, Ms. Kestrel reached into her bag and pulled out a small brass lantern, no bigger than a tea cup. It was beautifully made, with tiny glass panels and intricate metalwork that reminded Ivy of the token around her neck. She set it on the table between them and turned a tiny wheel at its base.

The lantern gave off no visible light, but the hum Ivy had been hearing suddenly became clearer, like tuning into a radio station. The air around the device seemed to thicken slightly, taking on the quality of water just before it starts to boil. Several students at nearby tables shifted uncomfortably in their chairs, though none of them seemed to know why.

"Can you feel that?" Ms. Kestrel asked, her eyes fixed on Ivy's face.

The sensation under Ivy's skin intensified, not unpleasant but impossible to ignore. It was as if someone had plucked a guitar string inside her bones, and the vibration was spreading outward from her chest. The token grew warmer against her chest, resonating with whatever the little lantern was doing. "It's like... pressure changes. Before a storm. But inside instead of outside."

"Exactly like that." Ms. Kestrel's smile was small but genuine. "Most people can't sense it at all. Others get headaches or feel dizzy. A few feel nauseous and have to leave the room. You describe it like someone who's been listening her whole life."

She turned the wheel again, this time in the opposite direction, and the feeling faded gradually, like stepping back from a fire. The students around them seemed to relax, returning to their books and quiet conversations. "How long have you been noticing things like this?" Ms. Kestrel asked as she carefully packed the lantern back into her bag.

"Since I was little," Ivy said, then stopped. She'd never admitted that to anyone before. At the children's home, being different was dangerous. It meant extra attention from the staff, questions from social workers, sometimes transfers to places that were supposed to "help" with behavioral problems. "I always thought I was just... I don't know. Nervous."

"Nothing nervous about it." Ms. Kestrel's voice was matter-of-fact. "Some people are born with better hearing than others. Some have better eyesight. You seem to have better... let's call it environmental awareness. It's not common, but it's not unheard of either."

Ivy looked around the reading room, suddenly seeing it differently. The way Ms. Kestrel had positioned herself gave her a clear view of every entrance and exit. The small brass lantern wasn't the only unusual item in her bag—Ivy caught glimpses of what looked like chalk sticks, a small notebook bound in oiled leather, and several other brass implements she couldn't identify.

"Are you some kind of scientist?" Ivy asked.

Ms. Kestrel's smile was enigmatic. "Librarian first, researcher second. But I've found that the two roles overlap more than most people realize. Information has a way of revealing patterns, and patterns..." She gestured toward the lamp overhead, which had returned to its steady, circular glow. "Patterns tell us how things really work."

"And the room downstairs?"

"Is where we keep the information that doesn't fit in the regular collection. Maps that show things besides streets and buildings. Books that document phenomena the city would rather not acknowledge officially. Records of... irregularities." Ms. Kestrel's eyes were sharp and assessing. "The kind of irregularities that someone with your particular sensitivity might find interesting."

Ivy felt a flutter of excitement mixed with apprehension. Part of her wanted to run back to June's house and pretend this conversation had never happened. But a larger part of her was desperately curious about what lay behind that careful, clinical language. "What kind of irregularities?"

Ivy touched the token through her shirt. "Is that good or bad?"

"Depends on what you plan to do about it." Ms. Kestrel glanced around the reading room, then back at Ivy. "There's a map behind my desk. Lamp numbers for the old quarter. You might have noticed some of them act differently than others."

"The one at my aunt's house stays steady in the wind."

"June Merrin's place." It wasn't a question. "That lamp's been reliable for years. Some of the others..." Ms. Kestrel paused, choosing her words carefully. "Some need attention from people who understand what they're really hearing."

Through the tall windows, Ivy could see the afternoon crowd moving along Library Row. A trolley bell rang twice at the crossing, and she noticed the way the sound seemed to settle something restless in the building's bones.

"Who gives them that attention?" Ivy asked.

"People like you, if you're interested." Ms. Kestrel stood and picked up her lantern. "There's a reading room downstairs after hours. Seven o'clock, if you'd like to learn more."

"What kind of reading room?"

Ms. Kestrel smiled, the expression transforming her serious face. "The kind where we read things that don't stay written in books."

She walked back toward her desk, leaving Ivy alone with more questions than she'd had when she arrived. The lamp above her table hummed quietly, its halo perfectly round now, as if it had been listening to their conversation and approved.

Ivy gathered her things and headed for the exit, but something made her pause at the reference desk. Behind Ms. Kestrel's chair, a large map was mounted on the wall, covered in small numbered circles connected by thin lines. It looked like a diagram of the night sky, if stars were arranged in neat rows and columns instead of scattered across space.

"Lamp maintenance chart," Ms. Kestrel said without looking up from her work. "Each number corresponds to a streetlight in the old quarter. Some burn brighter than others."

"What makes the difference?"

"Location, mostly. Age of the fixtures. How often they get attention." Ms. Kestrel's pen moved across a form, making precise notes. "And sometimes, the people who tend them."

Ivy studied the map, trying to memorize the pattern. Her street was there, a neat row of circles marching from the harbor up toward the market ward. Number 47 sat at the corner where June's rowhouse stood, marked with a small notation in Ms. Kestrel's precise handwriting: "Stable - J.M. maint."

The map was more detailed than she'd first realized. Some of the circles were filled in solid, others were just outlines. A few had small symbols beside them—stars, triangles, what looked like tiny question marks. Red ink traced lines between certain clusters of lights, creating a secondary pattern that had nothing to do with the actual street layout.

"The symbols," Ivy said. "What do they mean?"

Ms. Kestrel glanced up from her paperwork. "Maintenance codes. Stars for lights that need frequent attention, triangles for ones that are particularly reliable, question marks for..." She paused, as if choosing her words carefully. "For lights that behave in ways our standard maintenance protocols don't quite explain."

"Like the one above my table?"

"Like the one above your table." Ms. Kestrel's pen tapped against her desk once, twice. "Among others."

Ivy counted the question marks on the map. There were more than she'd expected—at least a dozen scattered throughout the old quarter, with a heavy concentration around the clock tower and the harbor district. "That's a lot of unexplained behavior."

"Greywater is an old city," Ms. Kestrel said. "Old cities have... quirks. Buildings settle in unexpected ways. Electrical systems develop their own rhythms. Infrastructure takes on a kind of personality after enough decades of use." She set down her pen and leaned back in her chair. "Most people just accept it as part of the charm. A few of us find it interesting enough to document."

"Ms. Kestrel?" Ivy said. "What's downstairs?"

"Storage, mostly. Old books that don't circulate anymore. Reading room for special collections." The librarian looked up, her expression neutral but her eyes watchful. "Maps like this one, but older. Records going back to when this city was first settled. Documentation of patterns that have been developing for a very long time." She paused. "Why do you ask?"

"Just curious."

"Curiosity is a useful quality in a researcher." Ms. Kestrel capped her pen and set it aside. "Seven o'clock, if you decide you want to learn more about what you're hearing."

Outside, the afternoon air carried the smell of rain and something else—salt from the harbor, maybe, or the metallic tang that came before storms. Ivy walked slowly down Library Row, looking up at each lamppost she passed. Most looked ordinary, utilitarian fixtures doing their job without fuss. Cast iron poles with simple glass housings, some newer than others but all serving the same basic function.

But a few hummed. Faintly, almost inaudibly, but there if you knew how to listen. 

The third one she passed had a slightly different note to it, higher pitched than the general electrical buzz. The fifth one was silent except for a tiny ticking sound, like a clock running slow. By the time she reached the corner where Library Row met Harwick Street, she'd counted seven that made some kind of sound, three that felt warm when she passed beneath them, and one that made the hair on her arms stand up for no reason she could name.

She was beginning to understand what Ms. Kestrel meant about paying attention.

She was halfway to June's street when she realized she was being followed. Not by a person—by the one-eyed dog from last night. He kept to the far side of the street, moving when she moved, stopping when she stopped. Never getting closer, never falling behind. His gait was slightly uneven, favoring his left front paw, and his coat was the kind of brown that had probably once been black before years of weather and hard living had faded it.

When she paused to look back at him, he sat down and waited patiently, as if this were the most natural thing in the world. His tail didn't wag, but it wasn't tucked either. He held himself with the dignity of an animal who had learned to expect nothing but hoped for everything.

"What do you want?" she asked, feeling slightly foolish for talking to a stray.

The dog tilted his head but didn't approach. His good eye was bright and intelligent, and there was something in his posture that suggested he was waiting for her to figure out the right question. The missing eye was a clean loss, an old injury that had healed well, leaving only a faint scar across the socket.

A trolley bell rang somewhere behind her, and she noticed the way the dog's ears pricked forward at the sound. Not startled—attentive. Like he was listening for something specific in the pattern of chimes. The trolley was still several blocks away, but he'd heard it before she had, and something about the rhythm of the bell seemed to satisfy him.

Just like she was starting to do with the lamplights.

Ivy crouched down and held out her hand. "Come here, boy."

The dog stood but didn't come closer. Instead, he took a few steps toward the next streetlight and sat down beneath it, looking back at her expectantly. When she didn't move, he whined once, very softly, and nodded his head toward the light.

She looked up. This lamp was one of the humming ones, but now that she was paying attention, she could hear that the hum had changed. It was softer than before, more musical. Almost like the little brass lantern Ms. Kestrel had shown her, but gentler.

"You can hear it too, can't you?" she said.

The dog's tail gave a single wag.

Ivy looked back toward the library, then at the dog, then at the neat row of streetlights marching up her street. Seven o'clock, Ms. Kestrel had said. If she wanted to learn more about what she was hearing. The dog seemed to think she should go, and honestly, her own curiosity was getting harder to ignore.

The token around her neck gave a small pulse of warmth, as if encouraging her toward a decision she wasn't quite ready to make. But maybe that was the point. Maybe some decisions were supposed to feel scary.

But for the first time since arriving in Greywater, she felt like she might be exactly where she was supposed to be. Not just in the city, but at this moment, with this choice in front of her.

"Alright," she said to the dog. "Seven o'clock it is."

The dog's tail wagged once more, and then he turned and trotted toward June's street. Ivy followed, noting the way he seemed to know exactly where she lived, and the way he avoided walking directly under certain streetlights while actively seeking out others.

Whatever was happening to her, she wasn't the only one who could sense it.

As they walked, Ivy found herself paying attention to things she'd never noticed before. The rhythm of her footsteps on the pavement. The way shadows fell between the buildings, creating pools of deeper darkness where the streetlights couldn't reach. The sound of water moving through storm drains beneath the street, a constant whisper of liquid motion that seemed to pulse in time with her heartbeat.

But most of all, she noticed the lights themselves. Each one had its own personality, its own way of burning. Some were bright and confident, others flickered nervously. A few had a warm quality that reminded her of candlelight, while others cast the cold, harsh glare of institutional fluorescents. She was beginning to understand that there was a whole language here she'd never learned to read, a conversation happening all around her that most people were deaf to.

The one-eyed dog paused at the corner where Harwick Street met Rowhouse Lane, looking back at her with what seemed like approval. His good eye caught the light from the corner streetlamp and reflected it back in a golden flash. For a moment, he looked less like a stray and more like a sentinel, as if he'd been assigned to watch over her transition into this new world of patterns and possibilities.

The dog waited until she started walking again, then fell into step on his side of the street, keeping perfect pace as they made their way home. And if anyone had been watching from their windows, they might have noticed that every streetlight the pair passed beneath burned just a little bit steadier, just a little bit warmer, as if their presence was exactly what the lights had been waiting for.

When they reached June's street, the dog sat down beneath the corner lamp and gave her one final look. His message was clear: she had a choice to make. Seven o'clock. The library basement. A room full of information that didn't fit in the regular collection.

Ivy touched the token through her shirt and felt its warm pulse against her palm. Whatever Ms. Kestrel was offering, it was connected to this warmth, to the way the lights responded to her presence, to the patterns she'd been noticing her whole life without understanding what they meant.

She looked up at the streetlight above the dog. It was one of the humming ones, but now the hum sounded almost musical, like a lullaby sung in frequencies just below the range of normal hearing.
