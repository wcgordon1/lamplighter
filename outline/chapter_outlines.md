## 1) A Door of Salt

**Goal:** Ivy wants to arrive without feeling like a burden.

- Ivy, soft: “Is it for luck or for something?”  
- June, dodging: “For keeping what’s outside, outside.”

**Magic and system**  
Seam level 1 hairline in doorframe. No binding performed. Salt pattern refreshed by June. Token warmth suggests resonance with true cadence.  
Order of operations observed only as habit: June salts sill after Ivy enters.
