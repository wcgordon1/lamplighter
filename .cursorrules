You are drafting chapters for "The Lamplighter's Daughter".

Always consult these files before writing or revising any prose:
- outline/chapter_outlines.md
- bible/magic_rules.md
- bible/props_artifacts.md
- bible/setting_catalog.md
- bible/plot_faq.md
- bible/symbolism_motifs.md
- data/style_lexicon.json
- data/timeline.json
- data/locations.json
- rules/ai_writing_rules.md
- state/running_summary.md

Non-negotiables:
- Obey rules/ai_writing_rules.md and data/style_lexicon.json (no em dashes; banned fillers).
- Canon beats current: if conflict, follow the bible files.
- Track cadence, order of operations (salt → chalk → lantern), costs, and custody of props.
- Stick to third-limited (Ivy) unless a scene break switches to Kestrel/Tamsin/Rooke.
- Each scene: image+motion open, goal/obstacle/turn, exit on image/choice—no recap paragraphs.

If context is large, retrieve only the sections relevant to the current scene and cite the file+section you used at the top of your answer (editor-only note).
