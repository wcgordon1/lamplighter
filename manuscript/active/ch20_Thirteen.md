# Thirteen

Floodlights, cameras, bunting. The bell counts toward an extra strike.

Ivy crouched in the clocktower's bell chamber, watching through the narrow window as midnight approached Founders' Green. Below, thousands of people had gathered for the traditional ceremony, their faces lit by camera flashes and the harsh glare of television lights. The festival had reached its peak, the crowd swaying to music from the bandstand while vendors sold last-minute souvenirs and children waved sparklers in the cool night air.

It looked like celebration. It felt like the moments before disaster.

The brass token at her throat had been burning cold for the last hour, responding to harmonics that made her teeth ache and her fingertips numb. The forced resonance from Bram's collar was building toward something that no city had ever been designed to withstand. Each pulse of current through the Keystone housing created pressure waves that propagated through every seam in the district, stretching the Veil thinner than it had ever been stretched.

"Positions," Tamsin whispered into her radio.

Around the district, the scattered members of their expanded team were taking their places. Kestrel at the lamp control station, ready to coordinate emergency lighting patterns. Rooke on the bell stairs, prepared to ring early if the timing went wrong. Facilities personnel at their legal observation points, officially monitoring the festival but actually watching for signs of seam activity.

And Ivy in the bell chamber itself, close enough to feel the massive bronze casting vibrating with each quarter-hour chime, waiting for the moment when everything would either hold together or fall apart.

The clocktower bell had been striking midnight for nearly a century, marking the end of each day with twelve measured tones that carried across the entire city. But tonight would be different. Tonight, the tradition called for thirteen strikes instead of twelve, honoring the memory of the first lamplighters who'd given their lives to keep the city's lights burning.

What the tradition didn't account for was what happened when that thirteenth strike was amplified by electrical current and forced through a seam network that had been deliberately destabilized.

"Eleven-fifty-eight," Rooke's voice crackled through the radio. "Bell mechanism ready."

Ivy could see him on the stairs below, positioned near the gear housing where Tamsin's clapper wedges waited to be deployed. His breathing was steady, controlled, the rhythm of someone who'd conquered his fear and chosen to act despite it. If the natural timing failed, if Bram's system overwhelmed their careful preparation, Rooke would ring the bell early and break the synchronization that the forced resonance required.

But first, they had to see whether the wedges would be enough.

"Eleven-fifty-nine," Tamsin reported from her position near the Keystone chamber. "Collar active. Pressure building."

Ivy pressed her palm against the bell housing, feeling the vibration that spoke of enormous forces being held in careful balance. The mechanism was a marvel of nineteenth-century engineering, gears and springs and counterweights that had kept precise time for generations. But it had never been designed to handle the kind of electrical interference that Bram's system was injecting into its operation.

Through the chamber window, she could see the crowd in Founders' Green reaching the crescendo of their celebration. The mayor was approaching the podium for the traditional midnight speech, the one that would officially welcome the new day and thank the city's founders for their foresight and sacrifice. Camera operators were positioning themselves for the best shots of the clocktower as the bell began its count.

None of them had any idea what was about to happen.

"Midnight," Ivy said into her radio.

The bell began to strike.

*BONG.*

The first strike landed exactly on time, the deep bronze note rolling across the district with the authority of a century's repetition. In Founders' Green, the crowd began counting along, their voices joining in the familiar ritual that marked the transition between days.

*BONG.*

The second strike came a heartbeat later, but Ivy could already feel something wrong in the vibration patterns. The bell's tone was slightly flat, affected by the electrical interference from the collar system. The crowd wouldn't notice, but anyone with Listener sensitivity could hear the wrongness in the harmonics.

*BONG.*

Third strike. The forced resonance was building now, Bram's system drawing power from the municipal grid and channeling it through the Keystone housing. The air in the bell chamber began to smell of ozone, the sharp scent that came from electrical work in places where electricity wasn't supposed to be.

*BONG.* *BONG.* *BONG.*

Fourth, fifth, sixth. The crowd was counting louder now, their voices echoing off the buildings around Founders' Green. Children on their parents' shoulders, tourists with cameras, locals who'd attended this ceremony every year since childhood. All of them gathered in one place, all of them trusting that the traditions that had kept the city safe would continue to protect them.

*BONG.* *BONG.* *BONG.*

Seventh, eighth, ninth. Ivy could feel the Keystone lantern responding to the collar's forced current, its light changing from the warm amber that had illuminated the sub-basement for decades to something harsher and brighter. The change wasn't visible from the chamber, but she could sense it through the brass token's connection to the city's deeper rhythms.

*BONG.* *BONG.* *BONG.*

Tenth, eleventh, twelfth. The normal sequence was complete, but the mechanism didn't stop. The extra strike was coming, the thirteenth toll that tradition demanded and engineering had never been designed to handle safely.

And then Bram's system surged to full power.

The collar discharged every amp of current it had been storing, forcing the Keystone's resonance into alignment with the bell's phase offset. The effect was immediate and catastrophic. Every seam in the district began to wake simultaneously, hairline fractures in reality's fabric suddenly gaping wide enough to let things through that had no business in the world of living cities.

*BONG.*

The thirteenth strike landed with a sound like breaking glass, the bell's tone fracturing into harmonics that made the crowd below stumble and grab at each other for support. The echo that came back was wrong, arriving before the strike itself in a way that violated every natural law about sound and time.

"Level Four!" Ivy shouted into her radio. "All positions, Level Four!"

Around the clocktower's base, reality began to fray.

The first signs were subtle: shadows that fell in the wrong directions, lamp halos that stretched into ovals and then into spirals that hurt to look at directly. But within seconds, the effects escalated beyond anything the city had ever experienced. Seams that had been stable for decades suddenly gaped wide, creating cold spots where the temperature dropped twenty degrees in as many seconds.

And the shades began to manifest.

They appeared first in the underground passages where Ivy's team had staged mirror panes during their reconnaissance. Wisps of concentrated coldness that seemed to absorb light and heat and breath, drawing energy from everything around them. But these weren't the isolated feeders they'd encountered in the Glazier's Tunnel. These were coordinated clusters, dozens of individual entities that moved with purpose and intelligence.

"Mirrors deployed," Tamsin reported, her voice tight with concentration. "Setting corridor patterns."

The mirror corridors were emergency infrastructure, reflection mazes designed to confuse and redirect shade activity until more permanent solutions could be implemented. But they required precise positioning and careful coordination, the kind of teamwork that could only happen when everyone involved understood exactly what they were fighting.

"Waltz cadence," Ivy commanded, pulling out her lantern and checking the vent settings. "Even three-count. Don't let them synchronize with the crowd."

In Founders' Green, the festival-goers were beginning to realize that something was wrong. The bell's final strike had left them disoriented, confused about which direction they'd been facing and why their voices sounded strange when they tried to call to each other. Some people were drifting toward the clocktower without conscious intention, drawn by forces they couldn't understand but couldn't resist.

"Kestrel," Ivy spoke into her radio. "Blink code emergency. Route people away from the tower."

"Already on it," came the librarian's steady voice. "Facilities teams moving to establish perimeter."

The lamp posts around Founders' Green began to blink in coordinated patterns, emergency signals that the trained personnel would recognize as instructions to guide crowds away from dangerous areas. Most of the festival-goers wouldn't understand the code, but they would follow the people who did, the way crowds always followed confident leadership during confusing moments.

But the shades were faster than human reaction time.

They poured out of the underground passages like smoke given substance, flowing around the clocktower's base in patterns that seemed random but followed a logic that Ivy could sense through her Listener sensitivity. They were seeking sources of warmth and motion, drawn to the largest concentration of life they could find.

They were heading directly for the crowd in Founders' Green.

"Corridor holding," Tamsin reported. "But there are too many. We need more mirrors."

"Use what we have," Ivy replied, climbing down from the bell chamber toward the stairs where Rooke waited. "Waltz cadence, maximum cycles. Keep them confused long enough for evacuation."

The mirror corridors were working, but barely. The shades were more organized than any they'd previously encountered, able to adapt to obstacles and find new routes when their preferred paths were blocked. Some of them were even learning to avoid the reflective surfaces, staying in the shadows where mirrors couldn't redirect their movement.

Ivy reached the stairway and found Rooke holding position near the gear housing, his hands steady on the manual controls that could override the automatic striking mechanism. His face was pale but determined, focused on the technical problem rather than the supernatural crisis surrounding them.

"Early ring?" he asked.

"Not yet," Ivy decided. "The wedges are working. Bell tone is wrong enough to break his resonance."

It was true. The clapper wedges that Tamsin had installed were doing exactly what they'd been designed to do, altering the bell's timing by fractions of a second and dampening the sustained tone that Bram's system required for maximum amplification. The forced resonance was still building pressure, but it wasn't building fast enough to tear the Veil completely apart.

But it was building fast enough to create the largest seam activity the city had ever experienced.

"Facilities report," Kestrel's voice crackled through the radio. "Crowd dispersal proceeding. Some injuries from disorientation, no fatalities yet."

"Yet" was the operative word. The shades were still flowing from the underground passages, and the mirror corridors couldn't hold them indefinitely. Eventually, some of them would break through and reach the people who were still trying to figure out what was happening and where they should go for safety.

"Ivy," Tamsin's voice was urgent now. "Chamber level. You need to see this."

Ivy made her way down the stairs toward the sub-basement, leaving Rooke at his position near the bell controls. The brass token at her throat was so cold now that it felt like ice against her skin, responding to Veil distortions that were stronger than anything she'd experienced during training.

In the Keystone chamber, everything was bright and wrong.

The Keystone lantern was burning at a level that made it painful to look at directly, its light changed from warm amber to something that resembled arc welding more than illumination. The electrical collar around its housing was glowing with heat, the lacquered band that concealed its set screws beginning to smoke and char.

And standing beside the control panel, watching the readings with satisfaction, was Bram Dore himself.

"Ms. Merrin," he said without turning around. "Right on schedule."

Ivy felt her breath go short, not from the ozone in the air but from the realization that everything they'd planned, everything they'd prepared for, had been anticipated and accounted for. Bram hadn't just engineered a crisis. He'd engineered a crisis that would require exactly the kind of response they were trained to provide.

"Order is mine," he said, finally turning to face her with a smile that held no warmth at all.
