# Chapter 10: Bunting and Orders

Founders' Green buzzed with the controlled chaos of festival preparation, scaffolding rising like metal bones around the temporary stage while crews strung bunting between the lamp posts in precise patriotic patterns. Ivy followed Ms. Kestrel through the maze of activity, stepping carefully around coils of electrical cable and stacks of folding chairs that would soon hold the crowds expected for Founders' Week's opening ceremonies.

The morning air carried the scents of fresh paint, trampled grass, and the particular mixture of anticipation and bureaucracy that seemed to cling to official events. Workers in matching polo shirts moved with practiced efficiency, consulting clipboards and speaking into radio headsets as they transformed the quiet green space into something that could accommodate thousands of spectators.

"Impressive operation," Ivy said, watching a crew position flood lights around the speaker's platform. "How long does it take to set all this up?"

"Two weeks of prep for three days of events," Ms. Kestrel replied, her expression carefully neutral. "The city takes Founders' Week very seriously. It's our biggest tourism draw and a significant source of municipal revenue."

"But you don't sound entirely enthusiastic about it."

"Large crowds, temporary structures, amplified sound systems, and compressed schedules," Ms. Kestrel said. "From a stability perspective, it's a recipe for problems. We've always provided extra monitoring during festival weeks, but this year..." She gestured toward a cluster of people in business attire who were deep in conversation near the main stage. "This year we have new constraints."

Ivy followed her gaze and saw a man who looked to be in his late thirties, well-dressed and confident, gesturing as he spoke to what appeared to be a group of reporters. His smile had the practiced warmth of someone comfortable with public attention, and when he laughed at something one of the reporters said, the sound carried clearly across the green.

"Councilman Bram Dore," Ms. Kestrel said quietly. "He's been quite active in municipal affairs lately, particularly around public safety initiatives."

"Is that good or bad for the Wardens?"

"That depends on how you define public safety." Ms. Kestrel checked her watch and adjusted the strap of her document case. "We're due at Council chambers in twenty minutes to discuss the new permit requirements. You'll get to form your own opinion about the councilman's approach."

As they walked toward the government district, Ivy found herself paying closer attention to the festival preparations. What had initially looked like simple decoration now revealed itself as a complex logistical operation involving multiple city departments, dozens of contractors, and careful coordination of utilities, security, and crowd management.

But there were things that bothered her about the setup. The lamp posts along the parade route had been fitted with additional fixtures that would provide extra illumination but also created visual noise that might interfere with normal monitoring. The temporary stages and scaffolding were positioned without regard for the acoustic properties that she'd learned to recognize as important for seam stability. And the electrical installations looked hastily done, with power cables running in patterns that seemed more convenient than safe.

"Ms. Kestrel," she said as they approached the Council building, "has anyone consulted the Wardens about the festival setup? From a technical perspective, I mean?"

"That's an excellent question," Ms. Kestrel said. "And the answer is part of why we're here this morning."

Council chambers occupied the top floor of a limestone building that projected the kind of solid respectability that municipal governments favored. The waiting area was paneled in dark wood and furnished with leather chairs that had been expensive when they were new decades ago. Campaign posters from recent elections still decorated the walls, and a glass case displayed artifacts from the city's founding that looked dusty and forgotten.

"Ms. Kestrel?" A young woman with a tablet and an efficient manner approached them. "Councilman Dore will see you now. He asked me to apologize for the scheduling change; the press briefing ran longer than expected."

They were led into an office that managed to be both spacious and crowded, filled with the kind of furniture and decoration that suggested its occupant took himself seriously. Bram Dore rose from behind a mahogany desk that could have served as a small stage, extending his hand with the same practiced warmth Ivy had observed earlier.

"Ms. Kestrel, thank you for making time in what I know is a busy schedule. And you must be Ivy Merrin; I've heard interesting things about your work with the historical society."

Ivy accepted the handshake, noting the careful phrasing. Historical society, not Night Wardens. She glanced at Ms. Kestrel, who maintained a diplomatically neutral expression.

"Councilman Dore," Ms. Kestrel said. "We appreciate the opportunity to discuss the new permit requirements. I understand there have been some changes to the after-hours maintenance protocols?"

"Indeed there have," Dore said, settling back into his chair and gesturing for them to take seats across from his desk. "Public safety is my top priority, and that means ensuring that all work performed on city infrastructure meets appropriate standards of oversight and accountability."

He pulled out a folder thick with official-looking documents. "The new requirements are straightforward. All after-hours work on municipal systems; lighting, communications, utilities; must be pre-authorized through the appropriate department heads. Emergency exceptions require supervisor approval and follow-up documentation within twenty-four hours."

"And the definition of 'municipal systems' includes street lamps?"

"Of course. Street lighting is a critical public safety infrastructure. We can't have unauthorized personnel making adjustments or modifications without proper oversight."

Ms. Kestrel opened her own folder and consulted a handwritten list. "Councilman, the Night Wardens have been providing lamp monitoring and minor maintenance services for over fifteen years. We have formal agreements with the Department of Public Works and established protocols with the police department."

"Informal agreements," Dore corrected gently. "Which is part of the problem. In today's regulatory environment, the city needs clearly defined chains of responsibility and accountability. We can't rely on handshake deals and goodwill arrangements."

"Our work has prevented multiple infrastructure failures and several potential public safety incidents."

"I don't doubt your good intentions, Ms. Kestrel. But good intentions aren't sufficient when we're talking about public safety. The city needs to know who's doing what, when they're doing it, and under whose authority."

Ivy found herself studying Dore's manner as he spoke. He was polite, even friendly, but there was something calculated about his approach that reminded her of salespeople who wanted to convince you they were doing you a favor while they took away something you needed.

"What about emergency situations?" she asked. "If there's an immediate safety hazard that requires immediate response?"

Dore turned his attention to her with what seemed like genuine interest. "An excellent question. Emergency protocols remain in place, of course. But the definition of 'emergency' becomes important, doesn't it? A flickering streetlight might be inconvenient, but it's hardly a life-threatening situation that requires immediate intervention by volunteers."

"What about situations where the flickering light is a symptom of larger problems?" Ivy pressed. "Infrastructure issues that could escalate if they're not addressed quickly?"

"That's precisely why we have trained professionals in the Department of Public Works," Dore said. "People with proper certifications, insurance coverage, and accountability to established supervisory structures."

Ms. Kestrel's expression remained diplomatically neutral, but Ivy could see the tension in her posture. "Councilman, our monitoring has identified patterns and potential problems that might not be apparent to standard maintenance crews. We've developed specialized diagnostic techniques over many years of work."

"Specialized techniques," Dore repeated, making a note on a pad. "Could you elaborate on those techniques? For the record?"

The question hung in the air with uncomfortable weight. Ivy realized that they'd reached the core of the problem: how do you explain seam monitoring and binding work to someone who doesn't believe such things exist? How do you describe the importance of listening to trolley line harmonics or recognizing the behavioral changes that indicate dangerous pull effects?

"Pattern recognition mostly," Ms. Kestrel said carefully. "Long-term observation of how various systems interact, particularly during weather changes or periods of increased activity."

"Pattern recognition is valuable," Dore agreed. "But it's also subjective. What one person sees as a meaningful pattern, another might dismiss as coincidence. That's why the city relies on objective measurements and documented procedures."

He leaned forward slightly, his tone becoming more confidential. "Ms. Kestrel, I'm not trying to eliminate the Night Wardens or dismiss your contributions. I'm trying to find a way to integrate your work into the city's official safety framework. But that requires transparency, documentation, and accountability to professional standards."

"What would that integration look like?"

"Formal training programs. Certification requirements. Regular supervision by qualified personnel. Insurance coverage that protects both the volunteers and the city from liability issues." Dore spread his hands in a gesture that suggested reasonableness. "Basically, the same standards we apply to any other public safety function."

"And in the meantime?"

"In the meantime, the permit requirements give us a structure for maintaining oversight while we develop longer-term solutions." He consulted his notes. "Speaking of which, I understand you've requested special permissions for Founders' Week monitoring?"

"The festival presents unique challenges," Ms. Kestrel said. "Large crowds, temporary structures, modified traffic patterns. We typically increase our monitoring during such events."

"Which is exactly why we need enhanced coordination this year. The festival is the city's most visible public event, and we can't afford any incidents that might reflect poorly on Greywater's safety reputation."

Dore pulled out another document, this one topped with the city seal and decorated with official signatures. "I've prepared a comprehensive safety plan for Founders' Week that coordinates all municipal departments and establishes clear protocols for emergency response."

Ivy scanned the document as he handed it across the desk. The language was dense with bureaucratic terminology, but the essential message was clear: all non-essential activities would be suspended during festival hours, all maintenance work would be performed by authorized personnel only, and any disruptions to scheduled events would require approval from the festival coordination committee.

"This would effectively prevent us from responding to problems during the busiest and most dangerous periods," Ms. Kestrel said.

"It would prevent unauthorized responses," Dore corrected. "Authorized responses would be coordinated through the proper channels to ensure they don't interfere with other safety protocols or create confusion among emergency personnel."

"And who determines what constitutes an authorized response?"

"The festival safety coordinator, who reports directly to my office." Dore smiled. "I've taken personal responsibility for ensuring this year's Founders' Week is both safe and successful."

"Including the Midnight Toll?"

For the first time, Dore's expression shifted toward something that might have been enthusiasm. "The Midnight Toll will be the centerpiece of our closing ceremonies. Thirteen strikes of the historic bell, broadcast live, with coordinated lighting and sound effects. It's going to be spectacular."

"Has anyone consulted with the tower caretaker about the additional stress on the bell mechanism?"

"Mr. Carrow has been very cooperative. He understands the importance of the festival to the city's reputation and economy."

Ivy thought about Carrow's obvious love for the clocktower and his protective attitude toward its mechanisms. "Cooperative" didn't seem like the right word to describe his likely response to plans that treated his bell as a prop for a light show.

"The tower's been experiencing some timing irregularities lately," she said carefully. "Nothing dangerous, but it might be worth checking the mechanism before subjecting it to additional performance demands."

"I appreciate the concern," Dore said, "but the Department of Public Works has certified the tower as structurally sound and mechanically reliable. Sometimes people who work closely with old equipment develop excessive caution about its capabilities."

The dismissal was polite but unmistakable. Ivy found herself wondering whether Dore genuinely didn't understand the technical issues they were discussing, or whether he understood perfectly well and had other priorities.

"Councilman," Ms. Kestrel said, "what would you need to see to be convinced that our monitoring work provides genuine value to the city?"

"Documentation," Dore said immediately. "Objective measurements, quantifiable results, cost-benefit analysis. Show me data that demonstrates measurable improvements in public safety or infrastructure reliability, and I'll be happy to consider formal recognition of your contributions."

"Data about what specifically?"

"Prevented accidents, reduced maintenance costs, improved system reliability. The kinds of metrics that justify public investment and demonstrate accountability to taxpayers."

Ivy realized the fundamental problem: most of their successes were preventive, and prevention was by definition invisible. How do you document an accident that didn't happen because you redirected a seam's energy before it could pull someone over a railing? How do you quantify the value of maintaining stable rhythms that keep the city's various systems synchronized?

"We'll consider how to approach the documentation requirements," Ms. Kestrel said diplomatically. "In the meantime, what's the timeline for implementing the new permit system?"

"Effective immediately for any new projects. Existing arrangements have a thirty-day transition period to allow for proper documentation and approval processes."

"And for Founders' Week specifically?"

"The festival safety plan takes precedence. All non-essential activities are suspended from noon on opening day through midnight on closing day."

As they left the Council building, Ivy found herself thinking about the implications of what they'd just heard. The new requirements wouldn't just make their work more difficult; they might make it impossible during the times when it was most needed.

"How bad is this?" she asked as they walked back toward Founders' Green.

"Bad enough," Ms. Kestrel said. "Thirty days to establish documentation for fifteen years of work, all while operating under restrictions that prevent us from doing the work in the first place."

"Do you think Dore genuinely believes he's improving public safety?"

"I think Councilman Dore believes in the power of properly managed systems and clear chains of command. Which isn't inherently wrong, but it doesn't account for the kinds of problems we actually deal with."

They paused at the edge of Founders' Green, watching the continued preparations. The festival setup was even more advanced than it had been that morning, with vendor booths taking shape and sound checks echoing across the space. The whole scene projected an atmosphere of celebration and civic pride.

But Ivy could see the potential problems more clearly now. The additional electrical loads, the modified traffic patterns, the crowds that would gather in areas not designed for mass occupancy. All of it during a period when the Wardens would be effectively sidelined by bureaucratic requirements.

"What's our next step?" she asked.

"We document what we can, file the permits that seem feasible, and prepare for the possibility that we'll need to work around the restrictions rather than through them." Ms. Kestrel adjusted her document case and checked her watch. "And we hope that Councilman Dore's confidence in official safety protocols is justified."

"What if it isn't?"

"Then we deal with the consequences and try to minimize the damage." Ms. Kestrel looked back at the Council building, its limestone facade gleaming in the morning sun. "Sometimes the most important work happens in the gaps between official policy and actual need."

As they walked back toward the library district, Ivy found herself thinking about the tension between order and flexibility, between accountability and effectiveness. Dore's approach made sense from an administrative perspective, but it didn't account for the reality of seam work: the need for rapid response, specialized knowledge, and the ability to operate in situations that didn't fit standard bureaucratic categories.

The festival preparations continued around them, a massive coordinated effort that would create three days of celebration and spectacle. But underneath the bunting and scaffolding, Ivy could sense the city's normal rhythms being disrupted by artificial lighting, modified traffic patterns, and the sheer pressure of trying to accommodate far more people than the infrastructure was designed to handle.

In three days, the Midnight Toll would ring thirteen times for the first time in a year, its amplified sound carrying across the city while crowds cheered and cameras recorded the moment for posterity. It would be spectacular, just as Dore had promised.

Whether it would be safe was another question entirely.
