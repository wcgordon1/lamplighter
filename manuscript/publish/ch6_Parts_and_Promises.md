# Chapter 6: Parts and Promises

The Market Ward Arcade stretched under a barrel-vaulted roof that channeled afternoon light into bright stripes across polished concrete. Ivy followed Tamsin through the maze of stalls and storefronts, her new lantern heavy in her canvas satchel, the route keys chiming softly against the token with each step. The air smelled of apples, solder smoke, and the particular mixture of leather oil and coffee that seemed to cling to places where people made their living with their hands.

"Park & Daughter Repairs," Tamsin said, stopping before a narrow frontage squeezed between a watch repair shop and a produce stall. The sign above the door was hand-painted in careful block letters, with "Established 1987" in smaller script below. "Dad started it when I was three. Mom joined him after she finished her electrical certification."

The shop was organized chaos—a wall of tiny drawers labeled in Tamsin's neat handwriting, workbenches with tools arranged in patterns that spoke of muscle memory and daily use, and the kind of clean disorder that came from knowing exactly where everything was, even if no one else could find it.

"Mom's doing estimates in the back," Tamsin said, leading Ivy to a workbench by the front window. "She'll want to meet you, but she's wrestling with a quote for rewiring the Founders' Green bandstand. City contract, so everything has to be triple-documented."

Button padded in behind them and immediately settled under the bench, his good eye fixed on a point in the middle distance where the light seemed to pool differently than the rest of the room. Ivy had learned to pay attention to his positioning—he always found the quiet spots, the places where the city's subtle tensions seemed to ease.

"Your kit," Tamsin said, unpacking a wooden case that looked like it had been assembled from salvaged shipping crates. "Maintenance tools first, then we'll talk about the vent wheel."

She laid out implements that looked like they belonged in a watchmaker's shop: tiny screwdrivers with wooden handles worn smooth, calipers for measuring tolerances, files with different grades of surface, and a magnifying glass mounted on an articulated arm. The precision was beautiful in its functionality.

"Lantern care isn't glamorous," Tamsin said, gesturing for Ivy to set her workhorse model on the bench. "But it's the difference between a binding that holds steady and one that wobbles under pressure. And when you're working level-two or higher, wobble can kill people."

Ivy opened the latches on her lantern case and lifted out the brass body. In the bright window light, she could see details she'd missed the night before—tiny maker's marks stamped into the metal, hairline scratches that spoke of careful use, and the subtle patina that came from being handled by someone who understood its value.

"First lesson," Tamsin said, pulling the magnifying glass down over the lantern's vent mechanism. "Quarter-clicks, not hope and prayer. The vent wheel controls how the mantle breathes, which affects the cadence resonance. Get it wrong, and your binding either fades too fast or locks too hard."

She demonstrated, her fingers moving with the same confidence Ivy had seen the night before. "True position is marked with this tiny notch—see it? From there, you can go up or down in quarter-click increments. Each position changes the harmonic by just enough to matter."

Ivy leaned in, trying to see what Tamsin was pointing at. The notch was so small it was almost invisible, but when she squinted, she could make out a mark no bigger than a pinprick.

"How do you even see that without magnification?"

"Practice. And good light." Tamsin moved the magnifying glass aside and picked up one of the tiny screwdrivers. "But more important than seeing it is feeling it. The wheel should move with resistance, not loosely. Loose means the threads are worn, which means the positioning won't hold under the pressure of an active binding."

She guided Ivy's hand to the vent wheel, letting her feel the subtle resistance as it turned. "One full rotation is four clicks. Quarter-turns give you sixteen positions total. Most work happens in the middle range, but for fine-tuning..." She moved the wheel a fraction. "Sometimes a sixteenth of a turn makes the difference."

"Show me again where true sits," Ivy said, trying to memorize the feeling.

"Here." Tamsin's finger found the position without looking. "But you can't just memorize the physical position, because different lanterns have slightly different tolerances. You have to feel for the sweet spot where the resistance is even and the mechanism doesn't fight you."

They spent the next hour taking the lantern apart piece by piece, Tamsin explaining the function of each component and showing Ivy how to clean the channels that regulated airflow. The work required patience and attention to detail, but there was something meditative about the methodical process.

"The mantle cage is where most people make mistakes," Tamsin said, lifting out the delicate metal structure that housed the actual light source. "Bell-metal is forgiving, but it's not indestructible. Force it, and you'll crack a mounting point. Be too gentle, and it won't seat properly."

A woman's voice called from the back of the shop. "Tamsin? Is that the new girl?"

"That's Mom," Tamsin said with a grin. "Fair warning—she's going to want to feed you and ask about your schooling."

Mrs. Park appeared from behind a curtain that divided the shop from the living quarters, wiping her hands on a towel. She had Tamsin's dark hair and the same oil-stained fingers, but where Tamsin was compact and quick, her mother moved with the deliberate efficiency of someone who'd spent decades balancing precision work with family life.

"You must be Ivy," she said, offering a hand that was warm and callused. "Tamsin's told me about your work with Ms. Kestrel. Important work, keeping the lights steady."

"Thank you, Mrs. Park."

"Call me Elena. And don't let my daughter work you too hard—she gets excited about gear ratios and forgets other people need to eat."

"I do not," Tamsin protested, but she was smiling. "Though speaking of eating, did you finish the bandstand quote?"

Elena's expression tightened slightly. "Finished it. Filed it. Probably won't hear back for two weeks, and by then they'll want to change half the specifications." She looked at the papers scattered on a nearby desk—invoices, receipts, and what looked like a ledger filled with careful columns of numbers. "City contracts pay well, but they're slow. And we need the cash flow sooner than later."

Something in the way she said it made Ivy pay closer attention. The shop was clean and well-organized, but she could see signs of careful economy—tools that had been repaired rather than replaced, inventory that looked lean, and a stack of past-due notices held down by a small paperweight.

"The Founders' Week rush will help," Tamsin said, but her voice carried a note of forced optimism. "Everyone wants their lamps checked before the festival."

"If we can source enough mantles," Elena said. "Foundry's been hit-or-miss lately. Quality control issues, they say, but I think they're prioritizing the big contractors over shops like ours."

She caught Ivy watching and managed a smile. "Don't mind the business talk. Tamsin's father always said you can't fix anything properly if you don't understand what's broken."

"Is the foundry the only source for mantles?" Ivy asked.

"Only reliable one," Elena said. "There are cheaper options, but bell-metal alloys are tricky. Get the composition wrong, and the harmonic response is off. For regular streetlamps, that's just inefficiency. For the kind of work you and Tamsin do..." She shrugged. "Well, you need equipment you can trust."

Tamsin had gone back to working on the lantern, but Ivy could see the tension in her shoulders. The maintenance work wasn't just about keeping equipment functional—it was about keeping her family's business viable, which meant keeping her own future secure.

"What about these?" Ivy asked, pointing to a collection of small wooden blocks on the workbench. They looked like they'd been rough-cut from hardwood, each one about the size of a thick coin.

"Practice project," Tamsin said, picking up one of the blocks. "Clapper wedges. You know how bells have a specific rhythm and tone? Sometimes you need to adjust that rhythm by tiny amounts. These wedges slip between the clapper and the bell housing to change the timing."

"When would you need to do that?"

"Emergency situations mostly. If a bell gets out of phase with the city's other rhythms, it can amplify problems instead of providing stability." Tamsin held the wedge up to the light, examining its edge. "Ms. Kestrel mentioned that the clocktower bell has been running slightly flat lately. A wedge might help, but you'd need permission from the tower caretaker, and he's... protective."

"These are just blanks?"

"For now. Each bell needs a slightly different size and shape, so you can't prefabricate them. But having blanks ready means you can shape one quickly if the need arises."

Ivy picked up one of the wedges, feeling the smooth hardwood against her palm. "How do you know what shape to cut?"

"Trial and error mostly. And hoping you don't crack anything expensive while you're learning." Tamsin set down her tools and looked at Ivy seriously. "That's the thing about this work—most of it is learned on the job, under pressure, when things are going wrong. The theory is useful, but the real skill comes from making mistakes and learning how to fix them quickly."

"Have you made many mistakes?"

"Enough," Tamsin said with a rueful smile. "Last month I misread a vent wheel position and let a binding run too long. Gave myself a nosebleed and Ms. Kestrel a lecture about respecting the work."

From his spot under the bench, Button let out a soft huff that might have been commentary on human foolishness. Elena laughed.

"Even the dog knows better than to overtax himself," she said. "Smart animal. He showed up about an hour ago and immediately found the calmest spot in the shop."

"He's good at that," Ivy said. "Finding the quiet places."

"Useful skill around here," Elena said, glancing at the stack of paperwork on her desk. "This business has its share of chaos."

As if summoned by her words, the front door chimed and a customer entered—an older man with paint-stained overalls and the kind of urgent expression that suggested an emergency.

"Elena? I've got a problem with the floods for the bandstand rehearsal. Half of them are flickering, and the city inspector is coming tomorrow."

"Tom, you're in luck," Elena said, already moving toward her tool kit. "Just finished writing up the bandstand electrical quote. Give me an hour and we'll have them steady."

She paused at the door. "Tamsin, keep working with Ivy on the vent wheel. And both of you—eat something. There's soup on the stove."

After she left, the shop felt quieter, more intimate. Tamsin had gone back to the lantern maintenance, but her movements had a restless quality that suggested her mind was elsewhere.

"The money pressure," Ivy said carefully. "Is it bad?"

Tamsin's hands stilled for a moment. "Bad enough. Mom and Dad built this place from nothing, but overhead keeps rising and the big contractors are squeezing out independent shops. The city work helps, but it's irregular."

"What happens if..."

"If we can't make it?" Tamsin set down her screwdriver and looked out the window at the arcade's bustling activity. "Dad's been talking about selling to one of the chain operations. They'd keep the location, maybe keep some of the staff, but it wouldn't be the same."

Ivy thought about the careful organization of the shop, the way Tamsin's tools were arranged with the precision of someone who'd grown up understanding their value. "Would you stay?"

"Don't know. Maybe. But it wouldn't be about the craft anymore, just about moving inventory and hitting quotas." Tamsin picked up another clapper wedge blank and turned it over in her hands. "This is what I know, what I'm good at. But being good at something doesn't always pay the bills."

The admission hung in the air between them. Ivy found herself thinking about her own uncertain situation—staying with June, learning the Warden work, trying to find her place in a city that still felt foreign. At least she had the luxury of uncertainty. Tamsin was watching her family's legacy balanced on a knife's edge.

"There might be other opportunities," Ivy said. "With the Warden work, I mean. Ms. Kestrel mentioned that the city is starting to recognize the value of what you all do."

"Maybe. But recognition doesn't always translate to funding." Tamsin set the wedge down and returned to the lantern work. "Sorry. I don't usually dump the family drama on people I've just met."

"It's not drama," Ivy said. "It's life. And I asked."

They worked in comfortable silence for a while, Tamsin guiding Ivy through the reassembly process. The vent wheel went back into position with a satisfying click, and when Ivy tested the mechanism, she could feel the smooth, even resistance that Tamsin had described.

"Good," Tamsin said, watching Ivy's technique. "You've got steady hands. That's half the battle with precision work."

"What's the other half?"

"Patience. And knowing when to stop before you break something." Tamsin packed away the tools with practiced efficiency. "Want to try lighting it? We can test the vent positions with a low-level cadence."

Ivy nodded, feeling a flutter of nervous excitement. The lantern felt different now that she understood its internal workings—not just a tool, but a precision instrument requiring respect and careful handling.

"March cadence," Tamsin said. "Two in, two out, nice and steady. Just enough to get the mantle warm and test the vent response."

Ivy thumbed the vent to the neutral position and began the priming sequence. Low-low-high. The mantle responded, glowing with the steady amber light she was learning to associate with properly tuned equipment.

"Now the cadence," Tamsin said. "Feel for the rhythm, don't force it."

In, two. Out, two. Ivy let her breathing settle into the pattern she'd practiced the night before, feeling the lantern's response as the light steadied and strengthened. This time, she could sense the subtle relationship between her breath and the vent position, the way tiny adjustments in airflow affected the binding's stability.

"Try moving the vent up a quarter-click," Tamsin instructed.

Ivy adjusted the wheel carefully, feeling for the resistance that indicated proper positioning. The light shifted slightly—not brighter, but more focused somehow, as if the energy was being channeled more efficiently.

"Good. Now down a half-click from neutral."

This time the light softened without dimming, spreading in a way that felt more diffuse but somehow warmer. Ivy held the cadence steady, counting cycles and feeling the lantern's response to each adjustment.

"Ten cycles," she said when she finally let the binding fade.

"Nice work. You held the adjustments without losing the base cadence." Tamsin made a note in a small notebook. "That's advanced technique. Most people struggle to maintain rhythm while making mechanical adjustments."

"It felt natural," Ivy said, though she was aware of a slight headache building behind her eyes. "Like the vent wanted to find the right position."

"That's exactly how it should feel. The equipment isn't fighting you, it's collaborating." Tamsin glanced at Ivy's face and frowned slightly. "Headache?"

"A little."

"Sugar water." Tamsin moved to a small refrigerator tucked behind the counter and pulled out a glass bottle. "Mom insists on keeping these stocked. Says anyone working with fine tolerances needs to keep their blood sugar stable."

The liquid was sweet but not cloying, with a slight citrus tang that cut through the sugar. Ivy felt the headache ease almost immediately.

"Better?"

"Much. Thank you."

"Part of the job. Taking care of the equipment includes taking care of the people using it." Tamsin capped the bottle and returned it to the refrigerator. "Ready for one more exercise?"

They spent another hour working through different vent positions and cadence combinations, Ivy gradually building up her sensitivity to the lantern's responses. By the time Elena returned from her emergency call, the light was beginning to fade toward evening, and Ivy felt like she'd gained weeks of experience in a single afternoon.

"How did it go?" Elena asked, hanging up her tool belt and washing her hands at a small sink in the corner.

"She's got natural feel for the work," Tamsin said. "Picked up vent sensitivity faster than anyone I've seen."

"Good news for Ms. Kestrel," Elena said, beginning to close up the shop for the day. "And good news for the city, having another person who understands the importance of keeping things steady."

As they gathered their equipment, Ivy found herself looking around the shop with new appreciation. It wasn't just a business—it was a repository of knowledge and skill, a place where the practical work of keeping the city functioning happened away from public attention. Like the Warden work itself, it was essential but largely invisible.

"Thank you," she said to Elena. "For letting me learn here."

"Thank you for caring enough to learn properly," Elena replied. "Too many people want shortcuts these days. It's refreshing to meet someone who understands that good work takes time."

Outside, the arcade was quieting as vendors closed their stalls and the afternoon crowd thinned toward evening. Button emerged from under the bench and fell into step beside Ivy, his good eye alert but relaxed. Whatever he'd sensed in the shop had apparently passed or settled.

"Next time," Tamsin said as they walked toward the arcade's main entrance, "we'll work on mantle replacement. It's delicate work, but once you know how to do it properly, you can field-repair a lantern instead of taking it out of service."

"When?"

"Day after tomorrow? I've got a delivery run for Mom tomorrow, but the afternoon after that should work."

Ivy nodded, feeling the weight of her newly-maintained lantern in her satchel. The work was more complex than she'd realized, requiring not just intuition but technical skill and mechanical understanding. But there was something deeply satisfying about learning to work with precision instruments, about understanding how small adjustments could create large effects.

As they reached the street, Tamsin stopped and looked back at the shop. "I know I complain about the money pressure, but I really do love this work. Building things, fixing things, making them better than they were."

"It shows," Ivy said. "In how you handle the tools, how you explain things. You care about doing it right."

"Dad always said there's no point in doing work you don't care about. Life's too short for sloppy craftsmanship." Tamsin shouldered her own tool bag and smiled. "Same time day after tomorrow?"

"I'll be here."

As Ivy walked back toward Rowhouse Lane, the route keys chiming against the token with each step, she found herself thinking about the relationship between precision and care, between understanding how things worked and being able to fix them when they broke. The lantern in her satchel felt different now—not just a tool but an instrument she was learning to play, one careful adjustment at a time.

Button padded alongside her, occasionally glancing up with his good eye in a way that suggested approval. In the gathering dusk, the street lamps were beginning to come on, their halos round and steady in the still air. For the first time since arriving in Greywater, Ivy felt like she was beginning to understand the city's rhythms, and her place in maintaining them.
