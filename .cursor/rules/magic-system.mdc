# Magic System Rules

## Order of Operations (CRITICAL)
ALWAYS: Salt → Chalk → Lantern
- Salt stalls/stabilizes
- Chalk shapes/redirects  
- Light binds/seals
- NEVER skip steps or reverse order

## Cadence Requirements
When binding occurs, always specify:
- Cadence name (latch, march, tide, waltz, bell, heartbeat, lull)
- Breath counts (e.g., "1 in, 2 out for 8 cycles")
- Physical effects on practitioner

## Seam Levels (0-5)
- Level 0: Normal, no intervention needed
- Level 1: Slight thinness, awareness only
- Level 2: Active pull, requires binding
- Level 3: Dangerous, crowd hazard
- Level 4: Critical, multiple practitioners
- Level 5: Keystone-level, major binding

## Props Tracking
- Track custody: who holds what items
- Note when props move between characters
- Record items consumed or damaged
- Salt tins, chalk, lanterns, tokens must be accounted for
