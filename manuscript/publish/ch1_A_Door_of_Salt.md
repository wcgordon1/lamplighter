# Chapter 1: A Door of Salt

Rain on brick. The door lamp's halo held round in the wind, which felt wrong to Ivy as she climbed the three worn steps to Aunt June's rowhouse. Most streetlights flickered when weather turned, but this one sat steady.

She wanted to arrive without feeling like a burden, but the house hummed faintly in the frame, a teeth-ache low vibration that made her pause with her hand on the brass knocker.

Salt lay across the threshold in a neat scatter—too neat to be accidental. It crunched softly under her scuffed boots as the door opened before she could knock.

"Shoes off inside. Mind the salt," Aunt June said, stepping back to let her through. She was broader than Ivy remembered, with work-callused hands and hair pinned with what looked like sewing needles.

Ivy bent to unlace her boots. "Is it for luck or for something?"

June's pause lasted a heartbeat too long. "For keeping what's outside, outside."

The hallway smelled of tea and old paper. A small lamp at the foot of the stairs threw steady light up the bannister, and the house's hum seemed to ease as Ivy stepped fully inside. She kept her questions quiet and followed June toward the kettle whistling in the back.

"You'll have the room facing the alley," June said, not looking back. "Lamp burns all night there. Some folks find it comforting."

Through the kitchen window, Ivy could see other rowhouses pressed close together, their windows glowing against the night. The kettle's whistle cut short as June lifted it from the stove, and in the sudden quiet, Ivy heard something else—a soft clink from the doorframe behind them.

She turned. A crack ran along the base of the frame, no wider than a pencil line. Something gleamed in the gap.

"What's that?" she asked, crouching down.

June set the kettle aside with more force than necessary. "What's what?"

Ivy worked her fingers into the crack and felt metal, warm to the touch. She pried it free—a brass transit token with a tiny lantern stamped in the center. The moment it touched her palm, the house's hum stopped completely.

"Oh," June said, very quietly.

The token warmed in Ivy's fingers like it recognized her. "Where did this come from?"

June pulled two mugs from a cabinet, her movements careful and measured. "Your mother always said you had quick fingers."

That wasn't an answer, but Ivy pocketed the token anyway. Through the window, she caught movement—a dog sitting beyond the door lamp's light. One-eyed, shaggy, watching the house with patient attention.

"There's a dog out there," Ivy said.

"Is there." June poured hot water over tea bags. "He won't cross the salt."

"Why not?"

"Dogs know things." June handed her a mug. "Drink your tea. You've had a long day."

The tea tasted like chamomile and something sharp that made the token in her pocket pulse with warmth. Outside, the one-eyed dog settled himself beyond the salt line, nose pointing toward the door like he was keeping watch.

Ivy sipped her tea and watched June move around the kitchen with the efficiency of someone who'd lived alone for years. Everything had its place—salt in a blue tea can by the door, dish towels folded precise as envelopes, a single plate in the drying rack. The kind of order that came from making do with less.

The kitchen felt lived-in despite its tidiness. Copper pots hung from hooks above the stove, their bottoms darkened from years of use. A small radio sat on the windowsill, turned low to catch the evening news. The countertops were worn smooth at the edges where countless meals had been prepared, and the wooden cutting board showed knife marks like a map of all the dinners June had made for one.

"How long since you've been here?" June asked, settling into the chair across from her.

"Three years." Ivy traced the rim of her mug, feeling the slight chip in the ceramic. "Since the funeral."

"You were smaller then."

"I was eleven." The memory came back sharp and clear—standing in this same kitchen in a black dress that scratched, trying not to cry while adults spoke in hushed voices about arrangements and paperwork. She remembered the way June had kept busy, making endless cups of tea for visitors who barely touched them.

June nodded, studying Ivy's face like she was looking for someone else. "You have her eyes. Your mother's." Her voice caught slightly on the words, and she took a quick sip of tea to cover it. "Same way of watching everything, like you're listening to something the rest of us can't hear."

The words hung between them, careful as the salt on the threshold. Ivy wanted to ask what had really happened to her mother, why the stories never quite matched, why June's mouth went tight whenever the subject came up. But the house felt fragile tonight, like the wrong question might crack something that couldn't be fixed.

Instead, she found herself saying, "The children's home had fluorescent lights. They hummed all the time, but some of them hummed differently. I could always tell which ones were about to burn out."

June's teacup paused halfway to her lips. "Could you now."

"And the radiators. The old building had steam heat, and you could hear it moving through the pipes. But sometimes it sounded like... like it was trying to say something. Like there was a pattern to it." Ivy felt heat rise in her cheeks. "I know it sounds crazy."

"Doesn't sound crazy to me." June set down her cup and reached across the table to touch Ivy's hand briefly. "Your mother used to say the same kinds of things. Always noticing sounds nobody else heard, feelings nobody else felt."

"What kind of feelings?"

June was quiet for a long moment, her fingers tracing the rim of her mug. "Like she could tell when storms were coming hours before the weather changed. Like she knew which elevator would arrive first in a building with four of them. Like she could sense when people were upset even when they were trying to hide it." She looked up at Ivy. "Useful things, mostly. Just... different."

"Is that why she—" Ivy started, then stopped. She'd been about to ask if that was why her mother died, but the question felt too large for the kitchen, too sharp for the careful peace they'd built.

"Is that why she what?" June asked gently.

"Nothing. Never mind."

June studied her for another moment, then nodded. "Some questions take time to ask. That's alright."

"The room's ready," June said, standing. "Clean sheets, extra blanket. Lamp oil's topped off."

They climbed the narrow stairs together, their footsteps muffled by a runner worn thin in the middle. The landing held three doors—June's room, a bathroom that smelled of lavender soap, and at the back, a small bedroom overlooking the alley.

"It's not much," June said, pushing open the door.

But it was everything. A bed with a patchwork quilt in blues and greens, a desk under the window made from what looked like repurposed ship's timber, and in the corner, a reading chair with a floor lamp beside it. The lamp was already lit, casting warm circles on wallpaper that showed tiny roses climbing thin trellises.

"The switch is by the bed," June said. "But I usually leave it burning. Old habit." She straightened a picture frame on the dresser—a black and white photograph of a woman who looked startlingly like Ivy, standing beside a much younger June. "Your mother stayed in this room when she first came to Greywater. Said she liked watching the lights come on at dusk."

Ivy set her bag on the desk and went to the window. The alley below was narrow and cobbled, with trash bins lined up like sentries and a few scraggly plants growing in window boxes across the way. The building opposite was similar to June's—narrow rowhouse, probably three stories, with windows that glowed behind thin curtains. She could see the shapes of people moving in their own small rooms, living their own quiet lives.

From this angle, she could also see down toward the harbor, where larger lights marked the positions of ships and the sweep of the lighthouse. The city spread out before her like a constellation, each light a small life continuing its own mysterious business.

"It's perfect," she said, and meant it. The room felt safe in a way she hadn't experienced since she was very small. Not just physically safe, but emotionally safe—a place where she could be herself without having to explain or apologize for the things she noticed that others didn't.

June lingered in the doorway. "Breakfast is at seven. I work until five most days—there's bread and cheese in the icebox if you get hungry."

"What kind of work?"

"Alterations. Wedding dresses, mostly. People need things taken in or let out." June's smile was quick and tired. "Always something that doesn't quite fit."

After June left, Ivy unpacked her few things into the dresser drawers. Everything she owned fit in two bags—clothes that had been washed and rewashed until the colors faded, a few books with broken spines held together by tape, the battered notebook where she wrote down things she noticed. The notebook was nearly full now, three years of observations about the way shadows fell differently in some buildings, the way certain streetlights hummed on quiet nights, the way some places felt like they were listening back.

She pulled out the token and set it on the desk where the lamplight could catch it. The stamped lantern was no bigger than her thumbnail, but the detail was extraordinary. Tiny lines showed the glass panels, the metal frame, even what looked like a wick inside. It was the kind of precision that took time, care, and steady hands.

The craftsmanship was old-fashioned, the sort of thing made before machines took over. Ivy had seen similar work in museum displays—Victorian-era tokens for omnibuses and early streetcars. But this one felt different. The metal had a weight to it that seemed disproportionate to its size, and when she held it up to examine the edges, she could see tiny marks that might have been numbers or letters, too small to read without a magnifying glass.

She picked it up and held it to the light. The metal was warm, warmer than it should be after sitting in a crack for who knew how long. When she turned it, the stamped lantern seemed to shift slightly, as if the light inside were real. The sensation reminded her of holding a compass near a magnet—a subtle pull, a sense of orientation she couldn't quite name.

More interesting still was the way it seemed to respond to the room's lamp. When she held the token closer to the light source, its warmth increased. When she moved it away, it cooled slightly but never went completely cold. It was as if the token and the lamp were having a conversation in a language made of heat and metal resonance.

She sat down at the desk and opened her notebook, flipping to a fresh page. At the top, she wrote "Greywater - Day 1" and then began documenting what she'd observed since arriving. The salt on the threshold. The house's hum that stopped when she touched the token. The way June had reacted to seeing it. The steady door lamp that should have flickered in the wind.

Writing it down made it feel more real somehow, less like she was imagining things. She'd kept this notebook for three years, documenting the small strange things she noticed wherever she lived. Fluorescent lights that hummed in patterns. Radiators that ticked like Morse code. Elevators that seemed to know which floor you wanted before you pressed the button. She'd never shown it to anyone, but it helped her feel less crazy to have it all written down in careful, precise handwriting.

A soft thud from below made her look out the window. The one-eyed dog had moved closer to the house, close enough that she could see the way his fur stuck up in wet spikes. He sat perfectly still, facing the door, like he was waiting for something.

Or someone.

Ivy turned the token over in her palm and wondered if her mother had touched it, if it had been warm for her too. The thought brought a sharp pang of longing, mixed with the frustration that had followed her for three years. Everyone had a different story about what happened to her mother. The official version was that she'd been lost at sea during a storm, but the details never quite added up. Some said she'd been on a fishing boat that went down. Others claimed she'd been walking the breakwater when a rogue wave swept her away. June's version changed slightly each time she told it, as if she were trying to find the right words for something that couldn't be properly explained.

The house was quiet now, settled into itself like an old coat. Whatever had been humming in the frame was gone, leaving only the ordinary sounds of an old building at rest—the tick of cooling radiators, the soft creak of wood adjusting to the night air, the distant murmur of neighbors through thin walls.

She got ready for bed and slipped the token onto the cord that held her house key. It settled against her chest, a small weight that somehow felt right. The metal was still warm, radiating a gentle heat that had nothing to do with her body temperature.

As she pulled on her nightgown, Ivy caught her reflection in the small mirror above the dresser. June was right—she did have her mother's eyes. Dark and wide-set, with a way of seeing that made some people uncomfortable. At the children's home, the staff had called her "watchful" and "too observant for her own good." Teachers had alternately praised and complained about her tendency to notice things others missed—the way Mrs. Henderson's hands shook when she was upset, the way the old gym creaked in a specific pattern before thunderstorms, the way certain fluorescent lights made a sound like insects just before they burned out.

Outside, rain continued to tap against the window, and somewhere in the distance, she could hear the sound of water moving through pipes, the city's hidden rivers carrying the day's rain toward the sea. The sound was soothing, rhythmic, like a heartbeat through the walls.

But underneath it, almost too faint to notice, was something else. A low hum, barely perceptible, like the sound a tuning fork makes when it's pressed against wood. It seemed to come from the walls themselves, or maybe from the network of pipes and wires hidden behind the plaster. Whatever it was, it felt connected to the token somehow, as if they were both tuned to the same frequency.

The lamp by her chair burned steady and warm, just as June had promised. Its light was different from the harsh fluorescents she'd grown used to—softer, more golden, the kind of light that made everything look like it belonged together. Ivy pulled the quilt up to her chin and closed her eyes, listening to the house breathe around her.

For the first time in months, she felt like she might be home. Not just because she had a roof over her head and someone who cared about her, but because something in this place recognized her. The token against her chest pulsed gently with her heartbeat, and the faint hum in the walls seemed to settle into rhythm with her breathing.

But in the alley below, the one-eyed dog kept his vigil, and the salt across June's threshold glittered like frost in the lamplight, holding the line between what was inside and what waited, patient and watching, just beyond the door. And if Ivy had been awake to see it, she might have noticed the way the streetlight outside her window flickered once, as if acknowledging her presence, before burning steady and true through the rest of the night.
