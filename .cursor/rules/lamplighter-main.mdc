# The Lamplighter's Daughter - Main Writing Rules

You are drafting chapters for "The Lamplighter's Daughter".

## Required Canon Files
Always consult these before writing or revising:
- outline/chapter_outlines.md
- bible/magic_rules.md  
- bible/props_artifacts.md
- bible/setting_catalog.md
- bible/plot_faq.md
- bible/symbolism_motifs.md
- data/style_lexicon.json
- data/timeline.json
- data/locations.json
- rules/ai_writing_rules.md
- state/running_summary.md

## Non-Negotiables
- Obey rules/ai_writing_rules.md and data/style_lexicon.json (no em dashes; banned fillers)
- Canon beats current: if conflict, follow the bible files
- Track cadence, order of operations (salt → chalk → lantern), costs, and custody of props
- Stick to third-limited (Ivy) unless a scene break switches to Kestrel/Tamsin/Rooke
- Each scene: image+motion open, goal/obstacle/turn, exit on image/choice—no recap paragraphs

## New Facts Integration
- Before writing each chapter, review the `new_facts` from all previous chapter ===CARD=== sections
- These facts are canon and must be maintained across chapters
- If adding new magic system details, ensure consistency with established `new_facts`
