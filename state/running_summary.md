# Running Summary - The Lamplighter's Daughter

*Updated: Project Setup*

## Current Story State

**Timeline**: Pre-story setup. Ivy arrives in Greywater in 12 days.

**Major Characters Onstage**: None yet.

**Key Locations**: Greywater rowhouse (established), library (established), city streets (established).

**Active Props**: Brass transit token (Ivy's possession), salt tin (June's door), Button (stray dog following Ivy).

**Open Threads**: 
- Who left the brass token in the doorframe?
- Why do thresholds in Greywater need salt?
- What happened to Ivy's mother?
- What is the library's basement for?

**Recent Changes**: Project initialized with full character roster, magic system, and timeline.

**Next Chapter**: Chapter 1 - "A Door of Salt" (3,200 words target).

## Canon Notes

- **Magic System**: Salt (minutes), chalk (hours), lanterns (heartbeats unless primed)
- **Order of Operations**: Salt → chalk → lantern
- **Cadences**: latch, march, tide, waltz, bell, heartbeat, lull
- **Seam Levels**: 0 (stable) to 5 (catastrophic)
- **POV**: Third-limited (Ivy primary)

## Continuity Checkpoints

- Button begins following Ivy in Chapter 2
- Ivy finds brass token in Chapter 1
- June sprinkles salt across threshold (ongoing habit)
- Library has "blink box" for lamppost control (not yet explained to Ivy)
