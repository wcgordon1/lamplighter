# About This Book

*The Lamplighter's Daughter* is a middle-grade fantasy novel about finding your place in a world that's more magical than it appears. Set in the foggy harbor city of Greywater, it follows fourteen-year-old Ivy Merrin as she discovers her ability to "hear" the weak seams in reality and joins the Night Wardens who protect the city from supernatural threats.

This story explores themes of identity, legacy, friendship, and the responsibility that comes with power. It's about choosing the living over the lost, and learning that sometimes the greatest magic is simply listening when the world speaks back.
