# Chapter Drafting Workflow

## YAML Frontmatter Requirements
Every chapter must include proper frontmatter from timeline.json:
- chapter, title, pov, day, time
- locations, motifs, seam_level, cadence_used
- props_in_play, goals, risks, change

## Word Count Targets
- Use `scripts/word_count_target.sh [chapter_num]` to check targets
- Target word counts are specified in timeline.json
- Count PROSE ONLY, excluding YAML frontmatter and ===CARD=== sections
- Aim within 100 words of target

## Continuity Card Requirements
End each chapter with ===CARD=== JSON containing:
- chapter, timeline, onstage, locations
- seam_level, cadence_used, cadence_counts
- props_moved (track all prop custody changes)
- new_facts (canon elements established this chapter)
- callbacks, open_threads, next_hooks

## New Facts Integration
1. Before writing, extract all `new_facts` from previous chapter cards
2. These are binding canon - reference them appropriately
3. Magic system details, character behaviors, world rules established in `new_facts` cannot be contradicted
