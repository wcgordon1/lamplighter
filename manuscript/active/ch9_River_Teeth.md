# Chapter 9: River Teeth

The Promenade stretched along the river like a necklace of light, its string of lamp posts casting amber pools across the weathered planks. Ivy walked between Rooke and Tamsin as the early evening crowd gathered for the weekly sunset concert, her lantern case bumping gently against her hip with each step. The air carried the mingled scents of fried dough, river spray, and the particular mixture of anticipation and salt that seemed to cling to waterfront gatherings.

"Good turnout tonight," Tamsin observed, watching families claim spots along the railing and couples settle onto the scattered benches. "Must be sixty people here already, and the music hasn't even started."

The bandstand sat at the promenade's center like a small island of possibility, its white-painted gazebo structure gleaming in the golden light. A three-piece ensemble was setting up inside: guitar, violin, and what looked like a small accordion; their instruments case open at their feet for donations. The musicians tuned and tested their sound levels, sending fragments of melody drifting across the water.

"That's what worries me," Rooke said quietly. "Big crowds, open water, musicians who might not understand rhythm safety. Recipe for problems."

Ivy had learned to pay attention to Rooke's concerns about water. His unease wasn't irrational; it came from understanding how seams could use large bodies of water to amplify their effects, turning what should be calming natural rhythms into something dangerous. The river below them moved with deceptive gentleness, but she could feel an underlying restlessness in its flow.

"Any readings yet?" she asked, touching the token at her throat. It felt normal temperature, but there was something in the evening air that made her skin prickle with awareness.

Tamsin pulled out a small resonance detector and took readings from the promenade's iron railing. "Background normal, but there's some instability in the lower frequencies. Could be nothing, could be the beginning of something."

They positioned themselves strategically around the gathering crowd, close enough to respond quickly but far enough apart to triangulate any problems that might develop. Ivy found a spot near the bandstand where she could watch both the musicians and the audience, while Tamsin moved toward the upstream end of the promenade and Rooke took a position near the downstream railing.

The music began just as the sun touched the horizon, sending long fingers of orange and gold across the water. The musicians had chosen well; a gentle waltz that seemed to complement rather than compete with the river's natural rhythm. The crowd settled into appreciative listening, parents lifting small children for better views, teenagers clustering near the bandstand's edge.

The violin's melody soared over the guitar's steady accompaniment, while the accordion provided a rich harmonic foundation that seemed to resonate with the promenade's iron railings. Couples swayed together in unconscious response to the three-quarter time, and several children began dancing in the open spaces between family groups.

For the first twenty minutes, everything felt perfectly normal. The music was competent and pleasant, the audience relaxed and engaged, the evening light soft and forgiving. A vendor moved through the crowd selling paper cones of roasted nuts, and someone had brought a thermos of hot cider that they shared with nearby families. The atmosphere was everything a community gathering should be: peaceful, inclusive, and quietly joyful.

Ivy found herself wondering if they'd been overly cautious in bringing three team members to what was essentially a community concert. The river flowed peacefully below them, reflecting the last golden light of sunset, and the city's rhythm felt stable and harmonious.

Then the wind shifted.

It was subtle at first; just a change in the river breeze that brought a different scent, something metallic and sharp that didn't belong with the usual mixture of water and urban air. The token at Ivy's throat began to cool, and she saw Tamsin straighten up from her position near the upstream railing.

The musicians seemed to sense it too, though they probably couldn't have articulated what was wrong. The guitarist's rhythm wavered slightly, and the violinist frowned as if hearing an echo that interfered with her melody. But they continued playing, professional enough to push through minor difficulties.

It was the audience that showed the first clear signs of trouble.

People began to shift position in ways that seemed casual but weren't quite natural. Conversations faltered as speakers found themselves distracted by something they couldn't identify. Children grew restless, tugging at their parents' hands and pointing toward the water with expressions of vague unease.

And slowly, almost imperceptibly, the crowd began to drift toward the promenade's outer edge.

It wasn't dramatic; just a gradual migration that brought more and more people closer to the low railing that separated the walkway from the fifteen-foot drop to the river below. Individuals moved as if seeking better views or more comfortable positions, but the overall effect was unmistakable to anyone who knew what to look for.

"Level-three development," Tamsin's voice carried clearly across the space, pitched to sound like routine maintenance chatter. "Initiating containment protocols."

Ivy felt her heart rate increase as she surveyed the crowd. Sixty people, including at least a dozen children, all slowly being drawn toward a potentially dangerous edge by forces they couldn't perceive or resist. The seam was using the music's rhythm as an amplifier, turning what should have been a stabilizing influence into a vector for its pull.

She moved quickly but casually toward the bandstand, pulling chalk from her kit as she walked. The musicians needed to adjust their rhythm before the seam could synchronize fully with their performance, but she couldn't simply interrupt the music without causing exactly the kind of public disruption they were trying to avoid.

"Excuse me," she said to the guitarist during a brief pause between songs. "I'm with city maintenance. We're seeing some minor acoustic feedback from the river; could you try keeping your tempo to a steady three-count? It'll help with the sound reflection off the water."

The musician looked puzzled but nodded. "Three-four time instead of the waltz pattern?"

"Exactly. Nice and even, no rushing or dragging the beat."

Meanwhile, Tamsin had begun laying a subtle salt line along the promenade's inner edge, working her way through the crowd with the casual efficiency of someone checking trash receptacles or light fixtures. The salt was nearly invisible against the weathered planks, but it would create a barrier that would disrupt the seam's pull without the audience ever knowing it was there.

Rooke had moved to the railing itself and was beginning to chalk chevrons on the iron posts, each one pointing away from the water toward the ascending street numbers that led back into the city's heart. His movements were quick and practiced, but Ivy could see the tension in his shoulders as he worked close to the river's edge.

The musicians started their next song in the steadier rhythm Ivy had requested, and she felt the seam's pull waver slightly as its synchronization was disrupted. But the effect was still building, and she could see that several people near the railing were now leaning forward in ways that brought them uncomfortably close to the edge.

"Salt's in place," Tamsin reported quietly. "Beginning lattice work."

Ivy pulled out her own chalk and began drawing connecting lines between Rooke's chevrons, creating the geometric pattern that would redirect the seam's energy into the promenade's structural framework. The work required her to move through the crowd, kneeling occasionally to complete connections at the base of lamp posts or railing supports.

"Just checking the lighting circuits," she said to a woman who asked what she was doing. "Making sure everything's secure for the evening events."

The woman nodded and returned her attention to the music, apparently satisfied by the explanation. Most people, Ivy had learned, were happy to ignore maintenance work as long as it didn't interfere with their activities.

But as she worked, she could see that the situation was becoming more serious. The crowd's drift toward the railing was accelerating, and several teenagers had climbed up to sit on the barrier itself, their legs dangling over the water in a display of casual bravado that would have been merely foolish under normal circumstances but was genuinely dangerous now.

"Rooke," she called softly. "We need to move those kids back from the edge."

"On it," he replied, but she could hear the strain in his voice. Moving toward the railing meant moving closer to the open water, and she knew that triggered his deepest fears about drowning and helplessness.

"Hey there," he said to the teenagers, his voice carefully casual. "City ordinance requires folks to stay on the walkway side of the railing. Safety issue with the evening crowds."

Most of the teens complied without argument, but one; a boy of maybe sixteen; seemed confused and disoriented. He swayed on his perch as if fighting against invisible forces, his eyes fixed on the water below with an expression of dreamy fascination.

"Come on down from there," Rooke said, reaching out to steady the boy. "Concert's behind you, not below you."

But the teenager didn't respond. Instead, he leaned further forward, his balance becoming increasingly precarious as the seam's pull strengthened. Other people in the crowd were beginning to notice the situation, and Ivy could see the first stirrings of the kind of alarm that could turn a controlled response into a panicked stampede.

"Now would be good," Tamsin said urgently, finishing the last connections in her section of the lattice. "Binding formation, tide cadence."

Ivy moved into position with her lantern, feeling for the rhythm that would counter the seam's pull. But this was different from their previous work; they were surrounded by civilians, including children, and any mistake could result in serious injuries or worse.

"Steady rhythm," she called to the musicians, who were looking increasingly puzzled by the crowd's strange behavior. "Whatever you do, keep playing that steady three-count."

The guitarist nodded and launched into a folk song with a rock-solid tempo, the violin and accordion following his lead. The steady beat gave Ivy something to anchor against as she began the tide cadence, feeling for the counter-rhythm that would break the seam's hold on the crowd.

Two-three in, two out. The pattern felt right, matching the river's natural flow while opposing the artificial pull that was drawing people toward danger. Her lantern responded, its light shifting from ordinary illumination to something more focused and purposeful.

Around her, she could sense Tamsin and Rooke establishing their own rhythms, the three patterns weaving together into a coordinated binding that began to push back against the seam's influence. The chalk lattice glowed faintly as energy flowed through it, redirecting the chaotic forces into the promenade's iron framework.

But the teenager on the railing was still in immediate danger, swaying forward with each pulse of the remaining pull. Rooke reached for him again, but the boy jerked away with a confused expression, as if he couldn't understand why anyone would want to stop him from following the fascinating call of the water below.

"I've got him," Rooke said, and Ivy heard him take a deep breath before stepping up onto the railing's lower crossbar to get better leverage.

She knew what that cost him; putting himself in the position he most feared, balanced over water with the responsibility for another person's safety. But he moved with steady determination, getting a solid grip on the teenager's shirt and speaking to him in low, calm tones.

"Easy there. Nothing down there worth seeing. Concert's up here with the rest of us."

The binding was beginning to take hold, Ivy could feel it in the way the seam's pull was weakening and the crowd's restless movement was settling into more natural patterns. People stopped drifting toward the railing and began to turn their attention back to the music, though many still looked vaguely confused by their own recent behavior.

"Twelve cycles," Tamsin counted quietly. "Thirteen. Fourteen."

"Got him," Rooke said with relief, helping the teenager down from the railing and guiding him back toward the safer center of the promenade. The boy looked around with a bewildered expression, as if waking from a dream he couldn't quite remember.

"Fifteen cycles. Binding stable," Ivy announced, letting the tide cadence fade back to normal breathing. Her lantern's light returned to ordinary illumination, and the chalk lines settled into a barely visible network that would continue channeling any residual energy away from the crowd.

The crisis was over, but the evening was far from finished. The musicians continued playing, the audience settled back into comfortable listening positions, and the sunset painted the sky in increasingly dramatic shades of orange and pink. To most observers, nothing unusual had happened; just some routine maintenance work and a teenage boy being reminded about safety regulations.

But Ivy could see the small signs that marked the transition from danger back to safety. Conversations resumed their natural flow as people lost the vague sense of unease that had been building. Children stopped tugging at their parents' hands and returned to their games. The vendor with the roasted nuts completed his circuit of the crowd without the distracted, confused interactions that had marked the seam's influence.

Most telling of all, the music itself had regained its proper character. The musicians' timing was crisp and confident again, no longer fighting against the strange interference that had made their performance feel slightly off-key with the evening's natural rhythm. The violin's melody soared cleanly over the river, and the accordion's harmony resonated properly with the promenade's iron structure.

But Ivy knew they'd just prevented what could have been a tragedy. Without the Wardens' intervention, that teenager might have fallen into the river, and in the confusion and panic that followed, others could have been injured as well.

"Nice work, everyone," Tamsin said as they regrouped near the bandstand. "Clean binding, minimal disruption, situation contained."

"How's the kid?" Ivy asked Rooke.

"Confused but fine. I told him he'd been standing too close to the edge and probably got a little dizzy from the height. He seemed to accept that explanation."

Ivy looked at Rooke with new respect. She'd seen him overcome his fear of water to rescue someone else, putting the work and public safety ahead of his own comfort. It was the kind of quiet heroism that defined the best aspects of the Warden tradition.

"Good job," she said simply. "Really good job."

As the concert continued, they remained in position to monitor for any recurring problems, but the rest of the evening passed without incident. The musicians finished their set to appreciative applause, the crowd dispersed peacefully, and the promenade returned to its normal state of gentle evening activity.

Later, as they walked back toward the library district, Ivy found herself thinking about the nature of their work. They'd just saved lives, prevented injuries, and maintained public safety, but their contribution would never be recognized or acknowledged. The official record would show nothing more than routine maintenance performed during a community event.

The evening air was cooling as they left the waterfront behind, carrying the scents of dinner cooking in nearby restaurants and the faint sound of laughter from other parts of the city. Street lamps began to come on in their precise sequence, each one adding to the network of light that helped maintain Greywater's stability. To anyone watching, they looked like three young people walking home after an evening out, their equipment cases no more remarkable than musical instruments or sports gear.

But Ivy was becoming aware of how much careful coordination their work required. Tonight had involved not just technical skill with salt, chalk, and binding patterns, but also crowd psychology, public relations, and split-second decision-making under pressure. They'd had to work around musicians, navigate through families with children, and maintain their cover as maintenance workers while performing delicate emergency procedures.

"Does it ever bother you?" she asked Tamsin. "That we can't get credit for what we actually do?"

"Sometimes," Tamsin admitted. "But think about it this way; tonight, sixty people went home safe because we were here. That teenager is going to wake up tomorrow with no idea how close he came to serious injury. Parents won't have to explain to their children why someone fell off the promenade."

"The work matters more than the recognition," Rooke added. "And the people who need to know what we do, they know. Ms. Kestrel, city officials who understand the situation, people like Sergeant Morrow who see the patterns."

Ivy nodded, feeling the weight of her logbook in her kit. Tonight would earn them all a CIVILIAN-ASSIST stamp, official recognition within the Warden community that they'd successfully protected the public. It wasn't a parade or a newspaper article, but it was acknowledgment from the people who understood the true value of their work.

"Besides," Tamsin said with a grin, "if people really knew what we were dealing with on a regular basis, half of them would never leave their houses and the other half would demand we do something impossible to make the problems go away permanently."

"Is that possible?" Ivy asked. "Making the problems go away permanently?"

"No," Rooke said firmly. "Seams are part of how cities work, like stress points in any complex system. The goal isn't to eliminate them; it's to manage them so they don't cause harm."

As they reached the library, Ivy could see lights in the basement reading room where Ms. Kestrel would be waiting for their report. The thought of documenting the evening's work, of adding their small success to the larger record of Warden activities, felt satisfying in a way that public recognition never could.

They'd done the job they'd trained for, protected people who didn't even know they needed protection, and proven that their skills could handle real emergencies under pressure. It was a good night's work by any measure that mattered.

"Same time tomorrow?" Tamsin asked as they prepared to part ways.

"Routine patrol," Rooke confirmed. "Unless something urgent comes up."

"I'll be there," Ivy said, shouldering her kit and feeling the familiar weight of responsibility settle comfortably around her shoulders.

As she walked home to Rowhouse Lane, the evening air carried the sound of distant music from other parts of the city: street performers, radios, the occasional church bell marking the hours. All of it wove together into the complex rhythm that was Greywater after dark, a symphony of human activity and natural forces that the Wardens helped keep in harmony.

The token at her throat had returned to its normal warmth, and Button appeared at her side as she turned onto her street, his good eye bright with what might have been approval. Whatever he'd sensed during the day had apparently settled into comfortable normalcy.

Inside June's house, the threshold salt was still scattered neat and precise across the door frame, and the kitchen lamp burned with steady, welcoming light. Ivy hung up her kit, washed the chalk dust from her hands, and sat down to write up the evening's work in her logbook.

Time, location, seam level, materials used, cadence applied, civilian count, successful outcome. Each entry was a small piece of the larger story of how a city stayed safe, one careful intervention at a time.
