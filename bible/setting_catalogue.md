# Setting Catalog — Greywater

*Canon reference for **The Lamplighter’s Daughter.** Use this to ground every scene in place, weather, sound, and civic reality. All details here are “true” unless later superseded by continuity cards.*

---

## 1) Orientation & Tone
- **Mood:** Maritime, lived-in, slightly haunted by its own infrastructure. Magic hides in maintenance and rhythm, not in spectacle.  
- **Visual palette:** Fog whites, lamp ambers, wet-slate grays, oxidized copper greens, bell-metal browns.  
- **Human scale:** Narrow streets, low skyline, neighbors who notice when a lamp stays dark.  

---

## 2) Era & Technology Level
- **Time:** Modern day. Smartphones exist but are background tools; the plot runs on lights, rails, bells, and paperwork.  
- **Power:** Municipal electric grid with legacy lamp circuits.  
- **Transit:** Heritage trolley in old quarters; buses elsewhere; ferries across the river mouth.  
- **Lighting:** Electric streetlamps in Victorian housings; the control network can blink posts individually or in rows.  
- **Comms:** City noticeboards, local paper, radio traffic for services; Wardens avoid radios on sensitive calls to reduce signal noise around seams.  

---

## 3) Geography & Layout
- **Setting:** A medium coastal city built around a tidal river that widens into a harbor.  
- **Population:** ~120,000 (old quarter ~20k).  
- **Topography:** Low ridges slide to water; the Clock Quarter perches on a knoll; culverts and tide tunnels honeycomb beneath.  
- **Edges:** Breakwater and lighthouse to the west; salt marsh to the south; newer suburbs eastward.  

---

## 4) Climate & Weather
- **Macro:** Cool maritime; frequent fog and light rain; strong sea breeze most afternoons.  

**Seasons:**  
- *Winter:* Long damp, high fog, bells sound closer than they are.  
- *Spring:* Unstable—clear mornings, veiled afternoons; seams wake near culverts after first warm days.  
- *Summer:* Golden evenings; tourists on the promenade; night fog rolls inland.  
- *Autumn:* Highest king tides; storm drains sing; Wardens busiest.  

**Phenomena for scenes:** Lamplight halos shrinking in mist; pavements slick with algae; bell tone “woolly” in heavy fog.

---

## 7) Infrastructure & How the City Works
- **Light:** Heritage lamps, numbered plates, controllable patterns (Kestrel’s code). Seams distort halos oval-thin.  
- **Power & Water:** Shared conduits under City Works; tide gates relieve storm pressure. Bram weaponizes conduit collar.  
- **Transit:** Trolley hum amplifies seams; ferries’ foghorns stabilize rhythms.  
- **Communications:** Council bulletins; Evelyn March’s broadsheet; Wardens’ blink/tap codes.  

---

## 8) Government, Law, and the Wardens
- **City Council:** Festival-centric; Bram leverages Founders’ Week for control.  
- **Facilities:** Practical, understaffed; cooperate with Wardens quietly.  
- **Police:** Order-focused; uneasy with Wardens. Sergeant Morrow = middle ground.  

**Wardens:**  
- Legal: Historical volunteer society.  
- Authority: Assist in lamps, signage, lane closures.  
- Limits: No arrests, no power-room access.  
- Escalation: Hazard → Wardens → Facilities → police if needed.  

**Friction:**  
- Permits vs. detentions.  
- PR battle: Bram paints them vigilantes.  
- Aftermath: Inquiry vindicates Wardens, exposes conduit scheme.  

---

## 9) Economy & Work
- **Sectors:** Fisheries, boat repair, fabrication, tourism, municipal jobs, repair shops.  
- **Money mood:** Tight margins, rent creep, survival by loyalty.  
- **Family anchors:** Tamsin’s shop, lamp merchants, stallholders.  

---

- **Lantern Walk:** Children’s dusk tradition; Wardens guard from flickers.  
- **Maritime Blessing:** Clergy bless nets/engines; layered bell-horn cadence.  
- **Street folklore:** “Keep the lights.” “Draw your break toward home.” Whispers of alleys and drafts.  

---

## 11) Architecture & Materials
- **Common stock:** Brick, sandstone, cast iron, slate.  
- **Interiors:** Tall windows, transoms, radiators.  
- **Industrial:** Riveted iron, catwalks, flaking hazard paint.  
- **Writer cues:** Chalk on rough stone; smears on paint; iron rails carry lattices.  

---

## 12) Law, Permits, and Paper Trails
- **Permits:** After-hours lamp work filed at Library.  
- **Detentions:** Bram’s templates cite “crowd hazard.”  
- **Evidence:** Invoices/logs expose conduit retrofits.  
- **Use in scenes:** Paperwork as obstacle, enabler, or reveal.  

---

## 13) Senses & Atmosphere
- **Sights:** Amber rings shrinking in fog; chalk ghosts; bell face dew; trolley sparks.  
- **Sounds:** Damp gears; faint hum; gulls; door chain in still hall.  
- **Smells:** Hot dust in lamps; brine; oil; old paper; ozone.  
- **Textures:** Salt rasp; chalk powder; slick iron; pitted brass token.  

---

## 14) Daily Life & Rhythm
- **Dawn:** Fishmongers open, Facilities vans roll, Wardens log.  
- **Midday:** School bells, market peak.  
- **Dusk:** Lamps string on, trolley hum clear, seam patrol prime.  
- **Night:** Fog deepens, bars close, bell quarters toll.  

---

## 15) Hazards & Public Safety
- **Natural:** Slick steps, king tides, fog banks, back-breath drains.  
- **Civic:** Parade crush, fireworks ash near lamps, tourists over rails.  
- **Anomalous:** Seams waking at rhythm nodes, shades at mirror piles, wrong echoes.  
- **Response:** Wardens stabilize, Facilities tape off, police manage crowds.  

---

## 16) Relationship Web
- **Wardens ↔ Library:** Custody, meeting space, permits.  
- **Wardens ↔ Facilities:** Quiet cooperation.  
- **Wardens ↔ Police:** Tense during Bram’s push, improves later.  
- **Council ↔ Public:** Loves parades, resents outages.  

---

## 17) Scene Starters
- A lamppost on the promenade flickers in short-long-long-short, and only one person looks up.  
- Rain beading on a half-erased lattice that now whistles like a tea kettle.  
- A trolley bell rings twice at an empty crossing; the overhead line hums a beat out of step.  
- The clocktower door is propped a thumb’s width by a wedge wrapped in cloth; the scent of oil is fresh.  
- A chalk chevron points homeward, but the street numbers behind it descend.  

---

## 18) Continuity Hooks
- **Ivy:** Rails, lintels, tide gates, damp clocktower steps.  
- **Tamsin:** Market Ward, City Works benches, lamp yards.  
- **Rooke:** River stairs, bell staircases—fear negotiated.  
- **Kestrel:** Library stacks, permits desk, lamppost control.  

---

## 19) Don’t Break These
- Greywater = modern with Victorian bones.  
- The Veil = civic skin, not portal wall.  
- Clocktower = central stabilizer, not dungeon.  
- Wardens = volunteers, not superpowered order.  

---

## 20) Quick Reference for Chapter Planning
- **Crowd:** Promenade at sunset, Founders’ Green during rehearsals, market at midday.  
- **Quiet:** Tide tunnels at noon, library stacks after closing, City Works at shift change.  
- **Danger:** King tide + fog on river steps; lamp box half open in rain.  
- **Visual payoff:** Fog rolling as lamps blink code; bell tone clears true after a bind.
