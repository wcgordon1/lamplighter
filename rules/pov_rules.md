# POV & Tense Rules

## Primary POV: Third Person Limited (Ivy's perspective)

- Stay in Ivy's head for the majority of chapters
- No head-jumping between characters within scenes
- Interior monologue limit: â‰¤3 consecutive sentences
- Show other characters' emotions through actions, not thoughts

## Tense: Past Tense

- All narrative in simple past
- Dialogue in present tense (as spoken)
- Flashbacks in past perfect when needed

## Chapter-Level POV Map

- Chapters 1-24: Ivy's POV (primary)
- Brief interludes: Consider other POVs for specific plot needs
- Always return to Ivy's perspective for major plot beats

## POV Guidelines

1. **Sensory Details**: Only what Ivy can see, hear, smell, touch, taste
2. **Emotions**: Ivy's emotional reactions to events
3. **Knowledge**: Only what Ivy knows or reasonably suspects
4. **Other Characters**: Interpret through Ivy's understanding and biases

## Prohibited

- Omniscient narrator voice
- Other characters' unexpressed thoughts
- Information Ivy couldn't reasonably know
- Sudden shifts in perspective without clear scene breaks
