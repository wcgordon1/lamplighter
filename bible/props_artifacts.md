## Keystone & Core Items

### 1) Keystone Lantern
- **What:** City-scale anchor light housed beneath the **Greywater Clocktower** in a brass/iron cradle on a vibration-damped plinth.
- **Physical:** 18 kg; brass body, bell-metal mantle cage; mica viewing slit; bayonet seat for the **Salt Prism**; side **Vent Wheel**. Emits low amber (not white).
- **Function:** When attuned by a **Listener**, projects a binding cadence through lamp circuits, bell harmonics, and tide gate rhythms to **stabilize the Veil** district-wide.
- **Operating Protocol (canon):**
  1. Inspect cradle bolts; confirm **isolation pads** are intact.  
  2. Seat **Salt Prism** (facet marker up).  
  3. Listener palm to Vent; breathe **in-2-3 / out-2-3** until body pulse matches hum.  
  4. Nudge **Vent Wheel** to lock cadence (+/- one notch to damp ringing).  
  5. If shades present, shift to **waltz cadence** (even 3-count) for 8 cycles, then return to march.
- **Failure Modes / Risks:**  
  - **Desynchrony with Bell** → amplifies seams (Bram’s plan).  
  - **External Current Injection** via **Conduit Collar** forces resonance; can “tear” weak edges.  
  - **Prism hairline crack** increases heat; risk of mantle scorch (Ch21).
- **Ownership:** City archive custody; practical control by Wardens.  
- **Seen:** Notes in Pike Diary (Ch11); sub-basement access (Ch18–19); attuned (Ch21–22).

### 2) Salt Prism (Focus Crystal)
- **What:** Transparent halite crystal cut to a shallow hexagon prism; edges chamfered; etched micro-grooves refract cadence.
- **Why:** Focuses “living cadence” into a coherent field; extends Lantern effect from room-scale to block-scale and, with the Keystone, to district-scale.
- **Care:** Store dry in padded salt-cloth; no bare-hand long contact (sweat pits facets). Clean with dry rice bed.  
- **Known Damage:** Hairline crack forms during the climax heat spike (Ch21); still functional but raises operating temp; log for replacement search in Book 2.
- **Failure Modes:** Wetting → clouding → field scatter; incorrect seating → phase wobble.

### 3) Vent Wheel (Cadence Control)
- **What:** Thumb wheel on Keystone body; vents mantle and subtly shifts cadence phase.  
- **Positions:**  
  - **0**: neutral (diagnostic).  
  - **+1/+2**: dampen resonance ripple (use after bell strike).  
  - **–1**: quick bind for small areas (short duration).  
- **Safety:** Move only by quarter-clicks; full turns can “hunt” for a false lock.

### 4) Brass Transit Token
- **What:** Old trolley fare token stamped with a tiny lantern; alloy resonates with seam hums.  
- **Use:** Orientation aid for **Listeners**; warms when cadence is correct; cools when phase slips.  
- **Owner:** Ivy (found Ch1).  
- **Continuity:** On cord around neck; used as “true north” near rails and tunnels.

## Field Kit (Standard Issue)

### 5) Warden Lanterns (three grades)
- **A) Reading-Room Lantern (Library)**
  - **Use:** Training; close-range bindings.  
  - **Build:** Lightweight brass; small mantle; 6–8 heartbeats unprimed.  
  - **Quirk:** Smells like old paper; quietest hum.

- **B) Workhorse Lantern (Patrol)**
  - **Use:** Street work, promenade, docks.  
  - **Build:** Heavier brass; shock rings; mica windows; 10–20 heartbeats **primed**.  
  - **Quirk:** Audible thrum near trolley lines; Tamsin tunes these monthly.

- **C) Sun-Warmed Lantern (Senior)**
  - **Use:** Large spaces; tunnel operations.  
  - **Build:** Thick mantle cage; heat sink fins; spare mantles under base.  
  - **Risk:** Overbinding headaches more common; sugar water recommended post-use.

**Fuel:** Odorless lamp oil blend; never gasoline. **Mantles:** bell-metal mesh; swap with tongs.

### 6) Salt Tins
- **Types:**  
  - **Sea (fine):** fast spread; best for spirals and “trip lines.”  
  - **Rock (coarse):** wind-resistant; best for **rings**.  
  - **Dyed coarse (blue):** visibility at night training; no craft difference.
- **Measures:** Spoon in lid = 10 seconds of spiral at normal pace.  
- **Rules:** **Salt first** (stall), chalk next (shape), lantern last (bind). Break the ring toward **home** (marked gap).

### 7) Chalks
- **River Chalk (white):** default; adheres to damp stone; draws clean lines.  
- **Shell Chalk (gray):** rain-resistant; for railings and iron.  
- **Slate Chalk (yellow):** warning marks; shows under amber lamps.  
- **Line Types:**  
  - **Lattice:** structural; redirects forces.  
  - **Chevron:** points homeward; used on bridges.  
  - **Loop:** closes shade circuits; mirror work.  
- **Failure:** Smear = lure; wipe completely and redraw.

### 8) Sigil Stencils & Compass String
- **Stencils:** Thin tin cards for perfect circles/chevrons; reduce error under stress.  
- **Compass String:** Knotted cord + chalk nub; anchors to nail/rail to draw arcs at correct radius.

### 9) Mirror Panes (Portable)
- **What:** 20×30 cm tempered glass with mirrored backing; padded edges; two per kit.  
- **Use:** Build **mirror corridors** to loop shades.  
- **Failure:** Crack = sharp scatter → shades panic; wear gloves.

### 10) Binding Cord (Lampwick)
- **What:** Treated cotton wick (2 m) doubling as **tourniquet** or **hasty tether**.  
- **Use:** Mark ring breaks; tie stencils; serve as Button’s collar in-world echo.

### 11) Field Logbook & Stamp System
- **Book:** Weather-proof; numbered pages.  
- **Stamps:**  
  - **SEAM-SIGHTED** (hourglass)  
  - **BOUND** (circle)  
  - **SHADE-ACTIVITY** (haze icon)  
  - **CIVILIAN-ASSIST** (hand icon)
- **Data to record:** time, temp drop, odor, cadence used, chalk type, salt amount, civilian count, injuries.

### 12) First-Aid & Overbinding Remedies
- **Overbinding:** copper taste, headache, nosebleed → sit, sip **sugar water**, breathe even.  
- **Kit:** gauze, glucose tabs, eye rinse, finger cots, mirror cloth, whistle.  
- **Rule:** No solo fieldwork after overbinding for 24 hours.

## Signals & Access

### 13) Blink Code (Lampposts)
- **Transport:** City lamp control line can blink lamps in short/long pulses.  
- **Core pattern:** **· – – ·** (Short-Long-Long-Short) denotes **message start**.  
- **Encoding:** Base-4 coordinates (row/column grid over old quarter).  
- **Use:** Kestrel directs trainees during detentions (Ch16).  
- **Risk:** Public notices it if overused; keep to low-traffic hours.

### 14) Route Keys
- **What:** Brass keys stamped with **lamp numbers**; open service hatches, maintenance closets, and some rail cabinets.  
- **Security Levels:**  
  - **Bronze:** lamp boxes only.  
  - **Silver:** lamp + rail cabinets.  
  - **Gold:** sub-basement doors (rare; librarian custody).  
- **Incident:** Cole leaked a **route map** tied to numbers (Ch13). All keys re-stamped “post-Bram.”

### 15) Tap Codes
- **Where:** Brick walls/railings.  
- **Meaning:** 1-1 = all clear; 1-2-1 = seam waking; 3-long = shades seen.  
- **Note:** Ivy’s **seam-hearing** can ride taps to find phase.

### 16) Map Plate & Cole’s Leak
- **Map Plate:** Laminated district schematic with lamp numbers; kept in patrol satchels.  
- **Leak:** Cole’s copied plate allowed Bram’s staff to position detentions and conduit crews under guise of “repairs.” Security audit logged (Ch23).

## City Hardware (Interacts with Craft)

### 17) Clocktower Bell & Clapper Wedges
- **Bell:** Bronze; tuned a hair flat from concert pitch; audible in fog as “woolly.”  
- **Clapper Wedges:** Tamsin’s wooden wedges that **delay/advance** strike by fractions (used to offset Bram’s phase in Ch21).  
- **Risk:** Mis-wedging can crack the bell over years; Carrow (caretaker) hates them—use sparingly.

### 18) City Works Conduit Collar (Illegal Retrofit)
- **What:** Brass/ceramic ring installed by Bram’s engineer to inject municipal current into the Keystone cradle.  
- **Effect:** Forces resonance and **opens seams** if timed to bell desynchrony.  
- **Evidence:** Invoices recovered post-arrest (see Documents).  
- **Removal:** Power down → loosen grub screws → slide off collar → cap feeder lines.

### 19) Trolley Lines & Insulators
- **Note:** Copper lines hum at seam frequencies in bad weather; insulators can “sing.”  
- **Use:** Wardens listen for **beats** carried along lines; Ivy finds several wakes this way (Ch7, Ch9).

### 20) Railings & Lintels
- **Role:** Structural **anchors** for chalk lattices; always point **homeward** (ascending street numbers or toward public light).  
- **Failure:** Painted-over iron reduces chalk adhesion—scrape first.

## Documents & Evidence

### 21) Pike Diary (Edna Pike)
- **Form:** Oil-cloth notebook; graphite drawings; cadence notation marks (dots/dashes).  
- **Value:** Only clear description of **Keystone attunement**; warns against festival desynchrony (thirteenth strike).  
- **Chain of Custody:** Rare stacks → Kestrel → Ivy (reading) → returned to stacks with copy extracts.  
- **Plot:** Leads trio into City Works arteries (Ch11–16).

### 22) Permit Folder & Detention Order
- **What:** Kestrel’s stack of “after-hours maintenance” permits vs. Bram’s “public safety” detention order template.  
- **Use:** Legal friction driving Ch13–14.  
- **Outcome:** Order vacated post-arrest; folder becomes part of public inquiry.

### 23) Conduit Invoices
- **What:** Paperwork linking **Mara Quill** and Bram to purchase of ceramic collars, step-down transformers, and unauthorized wiring.  
- **Use:** Grounds for warrant/ arrest (Ch22).

## Minor/Flavor Items (use for texture & callbacks)

### 24) Lantern Mantle Tongs
- **Small brass tongs** to swap mantles; click sound; kept in lantern base.

### 25) Oilskin Cloaks
- **Wardens’ rain cloaks**; smell of wax and smoke; pockets sized for tins and stencils.

### 26) Chalk Pencils & Sand Eraser
- **Pencils** for fine marks; **sand eraser** pouches to fully remove smeared sigils (prevents lures).

### 27) Tide Gate Keys
- Oversized iron keys; rarely issued; used to crack gates a finger for pressure relief during storms.

### 28) Breath Flasks
- Warm sugar-water flasks carried for overbinding and cold-wind chills. Metal dents easily—Rooke’s is flattened on one side (visual continuity).

### 29) Archive Key Rings
- Tilda Weir’s jangling rings; each has a **felt tag** color; deep stacks require green + brass token check-out.

### 30) Lamp Number Plates
- Enamel plates on posts; some numbers **skipped** due to old superstitions—confuses outsiders, not Wardens.

## Scene Seeds (how items drive beats)

- **Mirror corridor** + **salt ring** → shades loop until **waltz cadence** settles them (Ch15).  
- **Route keys** + **tap code** → stealth path beneath parade noise to tower (Ch18–19).  
- **Clapper wedges** + **Vent Wheel +1** → cancel Bram’s phase and allow Ivy’s **heartbeat bind** (Ch21).  
- **Conduit collar removal** → visual proof → **Mara flips** under questioning (Ch22).  
- **Transit token warms** at correct cadence → Ivy trusts breath over clock → moral choice favors the living (Ch22).

## Sensory Cheat Sheet (drop-in lines)
- **Salt:** dry mineral rasp; stings skin; footprints write the story behind you.  
- **Chalk:** soft scrape; ghost on damp stone; rain beads then veils it.  
- **Lanterns:** amber halo; mantle ticks when cooling; smell of hot dust.  
- **Keystone:** hum felt in teeth first; light feels **steady** rather than bright.  
- **Conduit collar:** ceramic warmth; faint ozone; wires “sing” a wrong chord.  
- **Clapper wedge:** wood thud before bronze; bell tone comes off “cleaner” or “crooked” by a hair.

---

## Canon Rules (do-not-break)
- Lantern craft is **cadence + geometry**, not incantation.  
- No new “tools” appear mid-book without a **cost** and an entry here.  
- Items **don’t teleport**; track custody in the continuity card after each chapter.
