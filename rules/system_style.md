## No Purple Prose Examples

### ❌ Avoid:
"The ethereal luminescence cascaded like liquid starlight through the gossamer veil of reality, painting the world in hues of impossible beauty that defied mortal comprehension."

### ✅ Embrace:
"The lantern light flickered through the fog, painting the cobblestones in warm amber. Ivy's breath made small clouds in the cold air."

## Voice Guidelines

1. **Concrete over Abstract**: "The wind smelled like wet paper" not "The wind was mysterious"
2. **Active over Passive**: "Ivy heard the seam" not "The seam was heard by Ivy"
3. **Specific over General**: "The brass token gleamed in her palm" not "Something shiny appeared"
4. **Sensory over Intellectual**: "The salt crunched under her boots" not "The salt was present"

## Sample Paragraphs (Desired Voice)

Ivy pressed her palm to the warm brick. The seam hummed beneath her fingers, a low vibration that made her teeth ache. She could almost hear words in the sound, like someone speaking underwater. The brass token in her pocket grew warm.

Ms. Kestrel's lantern cast long shadows across the library floor. Ink stained her fingertips, and she moved with the careful precision of someone who'd spent years handling fragile things. When she spoke, her voice carried the weight of secrets kept too long.

The wind that poured from the broken dryer smelled like old newspapers and something else, something that made Ivy's stomach clench. It moved like water, flowing around obstacles and pooling in corners. Button whined and pressed against her leg.
